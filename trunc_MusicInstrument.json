Buy one, you won't regret it at all.\n\nWe bought our first set of these, the Zenergy5 with five chimes, as a bit of a lark. They rapidly became a favorite, which use used nearly every day to announce dinner time. The chimes sat on an end table, and nearly every visitor would pick them up and play with them.\n\nWe lost the five-note chimes after we had a party and our house, and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them. At the end, we gave the chimes to him, which delighted him, and of course delighted us as well. The next day, we purchased the Zenergy3 three-rod version of the chimes, simply to have something different. We are equally happy with the three-tone chime.\n\nHint: Be sure to shop around! Vendors offer these chimes here on Amazon at a variety of price points, including shipping."

It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables, and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g., running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.\n\nThe jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell, and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies, so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.\n\nThey're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."

The tonearm can be raised instantly when installing a higher cartridge. The flexibility is exquisite. It plays 16 rpm to 78, and quartz locks on 33 1/3. Wee can stomp and dance and this A-T LP1240 turntable will not skip a beat, with any cartridge. I also have a Dual CS 515, a mint Thorens TD147.

My main gripe is that the rubber piece where the cable meets the connector fell out of the connector with almost no pressure whatsoever applied to it. The purpose of this piece is to keep cable bending force from getting inside the connector and damaging the connections between the wires in the cable and the connector pins (usually solder connections). With the rubber piece not serving this purpose, the cable is likely to fail much sooner than it should. I tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to. Maybe if I disassemble the connector... but hey, I shouldn't have to do that. Maybe this cable is OK for a studio where it is installed and never moved, but I would never take it out on a gig."

I use a magnifier to inspect my needles for wear and my old ones were not even in need of repair but I picked these up anyway for the price. I immediately compared them to the old ones to verify there was no wear on the older ones but I replaced them anyway because I did the \"break in\" procedure on my old needles which caused the shafts to develop kinks in them. I don't know if it had any impact on sound quality (especially for DVS), but for the price, I figured why not. I'm primarily an Ortofon user but these are great for DVS use and general playback, the needles are also cheaper to replace. Get them while vinyl is still around."

So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good.

Another thing is it's plenty sensitive, as it picks up noise from the high hat when I lift my foot to open it all the way, the sudden stop when it opens creates a faint ring.\n\nSo with that said, very good mic, and worth the money.

        "reviewText": "According to my order history, I bought this this kit towards the end of 2012 as a Black Friday Week Lightning Deal. I'm writing this nearly four years later.\n\nAs with any stringed instrument, the strings really needed to stretch out before they would stay in tune. So, for the first several days, it was play a few minutes, tune, play a few minutes, tune. Then it was tuning daily. After a few weeks of this, the uke held a tune great. A tuner is not included in the package, which is the bulk of the minus star because a real beginner wouldn't have a way to tune the thing. (You need either a tuner or a reference note, say, on a piano or keyboard.) You can download a decent tuner app, though, for a buck or so. Do it, because you're going to need it a lot for the first couple of weeks.\n\nThe \"Firebrand\" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. It's kind of dead-sounding. But then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it's part of their distinctive character. The finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. But the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. The beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there's nothing to snag or catch. Fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. The action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. The tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they're a definite step up from simple peg tuners. They make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. The bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don't have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.\n\nI visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what I paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. They were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. I left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. They're fun!\n\nThe bag is lightly made, unpadded, and has a fixed-length strap for carrying. It offered no advantage over just grabbing the uke to carry it, while adding the considerable disadvantage of needing to unpack it to play. It promptly went into the giveaway pile.\n\nWe haven't watched the DVDs, because the book has been great. It starts with C7 and F, and then adds C and G7, then G and D7. So it's not the C Am F G combo very common on YouTube. The songs are American folk traditionals, so if you've been around a campfire where any singing was involved, you've probably heard them before. There are lots of good instructions available online, including videos, so, really, the book is just a kick-starter to get you going. It's a pretty good book, with a reference section at the back with more chord diagrams than you're likely to need.\n\nIn all, it's an acceptable inexpensive starter set, not worth the \"list price\" but an OK value at Amazon's discounted price and a bargain at the Gold Box/Lightning Deal price.\n\nUPDATE: I changed the strings to the Aquila Nylgut AQ-4 set. Yeah, they're $10 strings on a $15 instrument, but the improvement in sound is just huge. I also polished the frets and fingerboard with a \"magic eraser\"-like product (an ultra-fine abrasive), shined up the body, and filed down the plastic saddle (which simply pops out of the bridge) to lower the action. It plays and sounds much better now, although the intonation remains sharp on several notes if you go note-for-note up the frets.\n\nUPDATE #2: OK, after going through the book I binge-watched the DVD. It consists of two segments of about 33 minutes each, each segment subdivided into easy-to-locate chapters that follow the pages of the book. It's really very good! The \"instructor\" (and remember, I bought this four years ago so this may have changed) was musician Julia Jordan. Production values were good, and the multi-angle views of playing were helpful, as were all the play-along segments. Minor quibbles: Jordan played a larger ukulele than the one in the pack, so you can't hold it in the exact same way. And it seemed like the songs were keyed to a higher register than her natural speaking/singing voice (you can hear her singing her own songs on a special feature and she's very pleasant to listen to).\n\nUPDATE #3: I now own a couple better ukuleles, have been a member of a ukulele meetup, and play a little almost every day. I can tell the difference between any of my better ukes and this one by both feel and ear. Still, it's a totally useable instrument, and it got me started on an enjoyable little musical hobby. Just remember to download a tuner app and maybe a metronome app and you're good to go."

The proximity effect is a bit more pronounced than the item description would suggest, but this microphone is crystal clear and absolutely transparent in its response. I've been involved in music, studio work, sound engineering, and performance for over 40 years, and, in this price range, this is an excellent value. When choosing a microphone for this time around as a lead vocalist in a rock and blues band, I auditioned 7 microphones. This one beat them all.

Especially since it had such great reviews.\nIve been using it for a couple of weeks and am very happy with it. Let me tell you why.\n\nThe rubber insulation on the cable is fairly soft and supple, making them nice and easy to stow away in a loop. The metal casings on the plugs are decent and can be unscrewed to open them making them serviceable should one of the wires somehow become disconnected.  Though you will have to remove the heat-shrink tubing which extends about three inches out of the casings. (You can see the white sheathing in the amazon photos). The only thing I might recommend that needs improvement is dropping the blue thread-lock on the threads inside the plugs because they tend to come loose over time. Otherwise, the cable is very good for the price.\n\nI recommend it."

It did not come out as bright as other people have said.. Man, this one cost as much as a piece of a new turntable, but it's worth every penny. Save up and get this one, you won't be sorry.\n\n*if your speaker tends to be bright, I will warn you when getting this cartridge as it may sound bright, but not everyone dislike the brightness this cartridge has produced, so just make sure you do your research and listen to as many samples as you need.

Usually, you're blowing too hard or you're not covering the wholes tightly. Also, you can make a note sound sharp or flat by blowing too hard or by blowing weakly. It's a musical instrument. You have to LEARN how to play it. Go to YouTube for help.\nThis recorder sounds clear and loud. Hole spacing seems correct. The holes are easy to cover and there is a clear distinction between notes.\nThick plastic makes it feel durable, but it's very light weight which makes it easier to play faster (since you aren't using much hand strength and coordination to hold the instrument up).\nLike any instrument, it will require some practice to get the hang of it and get proficient, but this is pretty easy to play. Meaning, you can get a good, strong sound and play some simple songs on it right away. At the price offered at the time of this writing (approx. $9), it's worth buying 2 (so you can play along with someone else)"

It makes records sound much more full with less surface noise and reduced pops and clicks from scratches. Smoother tone and slightly higher audio level is obtained from the installation as well. Includes all the hardware, needle, needle guard and four new wires for installing into an existing or a new tone arm shell. The needle guard can stay on the cartridge and flips up for use, down for needle protection."

They deliver unbelievable quality (for the money) in that application--and others.  As noted in other reviews here, however, be aware that the mic is very sensitive.  If you don't want a superb mic that is sensitive, you don't want this one.\n\nThis is one of those products that comes along every now and then where the designers just got tons of things right.  Also as noted elsewhere here, this MIC will do you NO good unless you have a device that has powered mic jack (plug-n-power). The GREAT thing about that, as long as you do have such a device and jack for this, is that you don't ever have to worry if your battery is about out on your mic and will drop out in the middle of recording something.\n\nIn addition to many things, I'm sure, this MIC works great with Sony Mini disc recorders, some (likely all) Sony Voice Recorders (really improves the quality of what those can do), Edirol RU 9, Ederil UA-1ex, etc. I think all higher end Olympus voice recorders also use this type of powered mic jack.\n\nGreat mic at great price. It comes with a cloth/coated extension cord that can be moved noisely.  Obvious, you want to use that extension anytime the device you are plugging it into creates it's own mechanical noises (like a Mini Disc recorder)."

        "reviewText": "The short version of this review: If you're a beginner I would not recommend this product. If you're an intermediate player approach with caution. If you're looking for a solid tool for home recording consider buying a nicer virtual instrument plug-in for your DAW or perhaps even a real Pocket POD before this thing. I am very disappointed in this product considering the other options.\n\nGuitarPort is marketed as being both a educational tool as well as professional recording tool, I will review both aspects separately. To use GuitarPort as an educational tool requires a monthly subscription fee to GuitarPort OnLine. The monthly fee is less than ten dollars and for that you get a fixed library of professionally recorded hit tracks from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, etc... For a given track you can download: without bass, without guitar or full mix. You can also download the guitar tab and tone settings. The tone settings will load the appropriate amp model, effects and then set up the amp and effects. You can hit the play and stop buttons and the tab will display on the screen. Sounds great right? Well, it is to a point.... The nice thing here is that you are downloading official tone settings and official tabs licensed by the publisher. The bad thing is that the tab playback software is pretty bad. It's just displaying a PDF on screen and scrolling as the track plays. If you've ever used a program like GuitarPro you will be very very disappointed in the TAB playback. Also the number of songs available is a problem. They aren't really updating their catalog. Lessons are OK at best (if the TAB playback where more like GuitarPro for features then the lessons would be much better, but it isn't). You might as well walk into a local music store and buy a book on playing, the lesson selections here (while some are very good) are not organized in a coherent way for a beginner. The product assumes the player knows what an effect box is, what the various settings on an amp does, etc... in short, it's not a beginners tool. Overall I would give this a grade C- as a learning tool. It has potential for intermediate players, but that's about it. There is another big problem with Guitar Port as an educational tool: NO BASS TABS are available through guitar port on-line and if you want the bass amp models and effects you will have to buy them on-line as an software upgrade for about fifty dollars! As a tool for bass guitarist, GuitarPort is useless.\n\nRegarding using GuitarPort for professional recording tool: When it comes to using software to simulate amps, rhythms, etc.. there are a few industry standards that make these sort of products compatible with a wide variety of DAW (digital audio workstation) recording software such as ProTools, Cakewalk, Ableton Live, etc..  the most popular standard is called VST. Line6 recently added GearBox VST as part of GuitarPort software package, so if you're looking to add Line6 POD quality models and effects for direct guitar studio recording, this is an inexpensive solution and really the only area in which Guitar Port shines (p.s. I still perfer the tone quality and features of Amplitube 2 for this sort of thing)\n\nOverall the GuitarPort a bit of a novelty product, it's not the amp models or effects are bad, it's just for about fifty dollars more you can pick up a PocketPOD and have all these great tones in a little battery powered, hand held device. You even hook the PocketPOD up to a PC using a USB cable and download the free software from Line6 to do almost everything you can with GuitarPort. I see a lot of positive reviews for this thing, so it seems it has made many people happy, but your money can be spent better elsewhere and if you are a beginner stay far away!\n\nOnly two stars for lack of coherence for the education/training this thing provides. GuitarPort on-line offers too little for what you get and absolutely zero bass guitar material in terms of tabs and lessons. Bass amp models (and a good number of PODxt models) require add on purchase here. You could easily spend $150 on add-ons before making the GuitarPort a viable studio VST instrument. Overall a decent product ideally that has been very very poorly executed."

It  works very well within twenty feet of your subject, provided that you have a clear view of that person. In other words it doesn't work well around corners, or even with other people standing between you and your subject.\n\n2. It does not function well at all in a busy convention center atmosphere. I just returned from a convention in Orlando where there were as many as fifty other wireless systems being used, and the Pro 88W system was almost completely useless. I had to resort to running a 12' cable to my spokemodel's microphone. Having more than just two channels may have helped this situation.\n\nCertainly the Pro 88 is a good value. It's constructed very well. I'm happy that it uses 3.5mm connections, (the same as my Canon DSLR) and requires a 9 volt battery, which are my favorite power source. However in my case I am going to have to upgrade to a more expensive UHF system.\n\nSincerely -\n\nRobert Marcos"

I suppose, one shouldn't expect much from $100 dollars instrument.  But I repeat, it's not great.  Now about bass strings.  They sound bassy, as I suppose, they must.  But the thing is their bassines overpower trebles. Trebles sound unproportionally weak. And yes, yes.  I did changed strings on a good ones (D-Adario normal tension something) upon getting this guitar from Amazon  I should say though that guitar starts to sound much better now than it was when I just got it.  But action on this instrument still kills my fingers.  I do finger pushups in order to develop muscle on my phalanges, in order, to play on this guitar somehow.  Of course, I could ask professional to fix bridge nut, but why would I do it for such cheap guitar.  My verdict-unless you want to develop your fingers, in order, to pull out nail with your bare hands, go for it.  I will send it back, and buy myself inexpensive Spanish brand."

Inherent capacitance of a cable CAN affect tone, but if you're getting tone-sucking capacitance in a six-inch cable, then it's broken and you need to get a new one anyway.\n\nThe only reason I don't like these ones is because of poor shielding letting in electromagnetic interference, not because of an inferior guitar tone. </soapbox>"

The bass output is noticeably less than my JVC HA-S700 and sounds muffled compared to those.\n\nComfort: 2 out of 5. I have a small head (adult small/x-small) and these feel too tight, after about 20 minutes using I have to take them off to relieve the pressure.  Even with them being tight, I plugged them into my amp and began to jam on my guitar and any movement more than a simple head nod made the headband flip on top of my face.  The only thing I like about these are that it has the cord coming from one side vice both.\n\nDurability: 1 out of 5. After two weeks of owning, I plugged them into my computer and listened to a little bit of music and all was normal.  I switched songs and noticed the right ear piece was not playing. I switched back to the song I was listening to before and still wasn't playing.\n\nI do not recommended the HF125"

The sound created by you touching the microphone body, changing / adjusting your grip is clearly transmitted to the system as well, whereas the SM58 did not have this problem. I think a noise gate may help this problem but that's a pro PA item and most people don't even know what it is.\nIt's built solid, like the other Shures.\nThe main function for the PG48, like the other reviewer said, is to get abused by bad /crazy bands and you won't feel too bad."

I used it and enjoyed it fully, but always wanted to go further than this puppy would take me.  Still, i want to mention that i did enjoy playing with this small keyboard quite a bit, and was tempted to buy the Rackmount version (MS2000) to see if it would be a deeper machine.\nI did and it was.

Like I said I have borderline abused this unit as any working musician normally does with their gear and this thing is built like a little tank and has served me very very well, and I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone who needs a sustain pedal for any type of keyboard. This particular unit is actually pretty nifty and small compared to a lot of the other units on the market which are bulky and cumbersome and take up a lot of room when packing up especially when you have limited space in your flight case, but this guys fit right in with my keyboard flight case in my extra storage compartment"

A copy of Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Ukulele with a CD\n3. Extra strings\n4. A \"gig\" bag.\n\nThe uke is laminated wood and  mediocre. The strings are average in quality. The book is fine, though I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Play-Ukulele-Today/dp/0634078615/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Play Ukulele Today!</a>&nbsp;for the rank beginner (it teaches the notes on the strings) and if you are somewhat familiar, then I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ukulele-for-Dummies/dp/047097799X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ukulele for Dummies</a>&nbsp;which has a lot on not only playing, but strumming, picking, styles and has a CD and many types of songs to learn.\n\nAs to the uke, believe it or not, a plastic-and-laminate&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Makala-Dolphin/dp/B0037CMDE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Makala Dolphin</a>&nbsp;though it looks like a toy, is an excellent instrument and when set up with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Aquila-Strings/dp/B003NJF1G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aquila Strings</a>&nbsp;sounds amazing. Many \"pro\" ukulele players and those who are advanced and own instruments that cost into the thousands, own a Dolphin and play it with pleasure. It comes in a myriad of colors, so if you are looking for something battle-solid, funky and kid-friendly, the Dolphin with Aquila strings has it all.\n\nIf you want to save money, this still is a good deal, but I suggest you change the strings to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Aquila-Strings/dp/B003NJF1G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aquila Strings</a>&nbsp;no matter what spare strings come with it. This is a soprano, by the way, so when buying strings, that's the size to look for. Aquilas are made of a nylon that makes a loud, rich sound and they are known for bringing out the sound of even poorer quality instruments. And you need a tuner--the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Snark-Tuner/dp/B003VWKPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Snark Tuner</a>is not expensive and can be used on other types of instruments as well (guitar, etc.)\n\nThis was a good deal at under thirty simoleons, but if you are really serious to learn uke or want your kids to learn, the setup I mentioned may keep them interested longer. The quality of strings and the quality of a cheap uke can be optimized to the point where it's more than barely playable, and one mistake people make when taking up a musical instrument is to buy one that is so inexpensive, that it frustrates the learner. I have had this happen with the flute and the guitar. It really makes a difference what you learn on, and you have to balance the desire not to invest too much at first with the fact that too cheap a setup will just lead to failure.\n\nFor the record, I own a red Dolphin. I played uke as a kid and was able to pick up the instrument after 50 years of not playing, learn fingerstyle (picking) and enjoy playing it until I got a more serious instrument that indeed plays more sweetly. But I actually play the Dolphin quite a lot and enjoy its sound.\n\nThe setup I propose here will do you better as an adult, and will suit a child as well. You'll spend about twice as much but your chances for success are, in my opinion, a lot better. There are some excellent sites to visit to get free advice and to subscribe to video lessons (ukulele underground is my favorite.) Check out what I say and see if others don't agree with me. At the very least, if you opt for this package, get the better strings and the tuner. I guarantee you will be happier."

She has learned to move between most chords quickly and without difficulty. I have her using a capo for songs in the key of C as she has some trouble holding F chord but she will master that.\nAlso, the instruction materials that come with the system are great. She faithfully practiced for at least an hour every night sore fingers and all but after five weeks I can't believe what she has accomplished.\nI don't believe that just anyone could do what she's done in five weeks because she was driven to play. I have a small recording studio and she plays piano for our recording sessions which helps her as she understands cord progression and structure.\nBut... If you have wanted to learn to strum a guitar using proper chords to play most any songs, don't hesitate to get the Chordbuddy. It is beyond doubt the best way to learn to play a guitar I've ever seen!"

A low battery light would be nice, but no big deal at this price point plus those batteries are cheap as chips. They seem to last as well. Although I have extras on standby, the original battery hasn't been changed. Keep in mind I don't use it every day, but I do use it regularly. I think someone here said they got about a year of  use... I can believe that. Your mileage may vary.  I have a cheap Panasonic SD camcorder that is being replaced with a better HD model. Partly because of this mic. Construction seems solid. The wire is really not an issue to me. Glad they made it extra long....I mean if you're gonna give me a wire......Sound and pick up is amazing for the price. Use it to do voice overs on my videos, interviews, video chatting.

I will say it is fun to be able to play chords at the start and helps familiarize the absolute beginner (me) with how the chords work.  I can't yet speak to how well the device helps you progress with learning the chords - it is a novel concept: you gradually remove the \"keys\" and finger the chords yourself, ultimately removing the device entirely once you've mastered the chords. I agree that it takes a bit of the frustration of learning, because you are playing chords right away, and I think that helps make learning fun.\nReally, my only complaint is that it's a bit expensive.

For $40 don't expect recording quality but don't be afraid to buy this mic if you are just starting out and playing small gigs with a small budget. This mic is  professional quality compared to some I've used to sing through in the past. I'm using it now as a vocal mic in a small jam band playing in senior citizens centers and nursing homes.  Heck, I'm an old guy that doesn't play the joints anymore, playing with some other guys in the same situation, so I've been through a lot of mics in my experience.  I really like this mic, it's well made and does a fine job in the setting I'm using it.

I just purchased this for my nine-year-old daughter.  I had originally ordered a Luna Aurora Faerie guitar but sent it back.  The Luna was mostly plastic and assembled so poorly, that calling it anything but a toy would be untrue.  The Yamaha is another story.  It actually has a spruce top, wooden bridge and adjustable truss bar.  It is a real guitar in every sense of the word.  It is a true 3/4 scale guitar despite was others with little or no knowledge of guitars have posted.  The out-of-box action (string height) is good and can be played \"as is.\"  For a better experience, it should be taken to a guitar shop and adjusted (set up) properly.  Action is adjusted by raising or lowering the neck or bridge nut, not by adjusting the truss rod - as many people attempt to do.\n\nAs to the sound, it's great!  A 3/4 scale guitar is not going to project loud, but it's tone is very pleasing.  I would recommend getting light strings (11-47 or thinner) for a beginner.  The guitar stays in tune well, I have not had a problem with the tuners as others have claimed.  The neck and frets are first class.  The size is perfect for a child.  All in all this guitar is great.  For the money, or even for several hundreds more, you will not find a better guitar.  I highly recommend it."

And it is a great premise, the books/DVD are very well done.  Where it falls short for me is in the actual device.  The plastic 'fingers' tend to drift a bit (they are removable), and they hit each other and mess things up.  But the major flaw is how it attaches to the guitar.  It clamps to the neck on the sides, however, the Chord Buddy needs to stay above the strings (so as to not hit the wrong notes), so it also needs something to hold the top solidly.  But any pressure on the buttons causes it to 'fall' down a bit, making contact with the wrong strings.  I'm going to try to clamp it so this doesn't happen, but with the finger drift, I'm not sure this will work anyway.  One wonders what would have happened if they had used better materials?\n\nUpdate:  figured I'd post this, maybe it will help others.  I had to file some edges of the fingers that were rubbing against each other.  Then, in order to stop them from 'drifting' back into each other, I had to glue them (fingers not removable anymore!).  No biggie for me, as I don't see doing half Chord Buddy, half fingering anyway.  The biggest fix came in keeping the Chord Buddy from tilting down.  I took a rubber band and looped it over the rounded plastic (by the tightening screw), underneath the neck and hooked to the other side.  This gives it enough tension so as to not continually flop down.\n\nWhile it now works, I can't give a better grade.  For this much money, it should work well out of the box.\n\nSecond Update:  I also picked up a copy of Rocksmith.  I would have to say that Chord Buddy makes you feel like you are playing a song (strumming a few chords is all it is really doing).  Rocksmith lets you play single notes and then graduate to more, while also making you feel like you are playing along.  I would have to recommend Rocksmith over Chord Buddy, and it's cheaper to boot!"

But compare this mic system at around $120 (as of my purchase) with similar systems costing $500, $600, and more.  Yes, you generally get what you pay for - and I may upgrade one day to a more expensive mic system. But so far, I am very impressed with the PRO 88W set.\n\nI have uploaded a video review that is hopefully more informative and demonstrative of this system and its performance. Please take a look at it if you have the time, it might help you with your purchase decision.\n\nI plan to use this system indoors and outdoors - and sometimes in harsh environments.  I may do some updates to this review over time, to note (good or bad) how it performs over time and different projects.\n\nProduct information says to expect an average of 8 hours for the battery life. The use of the system requires two 9-volt batteries (one each in the receiver and the transmitter)."

Very muddy sounding, but will add more \"body\" to your sound.\n\nShure: cold-sounding mic, highs better than Senns, some mid-range muddiness.\n\nAKG: overall nice sounding mic.  Problem when you \"push\" the mic, i.e. sing loud.  Mic feels like it has a delay in it.\n\nAudix: very nice sounding mic.  No major sonic problems.  Nice, extended highs.  It's the shadow of the awesome OM-5 ($250+) which is faster and has even better clarity.\n\nMy advice: go with the Audix OM-2, or spend $200+ for an Audix OM-5 or Senn 935.

In vocal mode, I have singed normal, loud and louder and it feels like it has a deep response, like if someone was pulling the mic back so that it does the vocals don't hit the bottom. in other words, this type of quality mic, will be able to handle louder volumes and louder sinnging, with out a popin sound and feeling like when you sing without a microphone. I also used it to microphone a set of hometheater front speaker and it sounded great on my powered PA loudspeaker, which means this is a very dynamic and good for bunch of things microphone, since it's good for both vocals and instrument or electric guitar amp microphone.

I even put little rubber feet on the other side of the board.  This setup works perfectly.\n\nThe YPT-300 senses the position of the mode switch when it is first turned on to determine if switch closed or switch open means sustain.  This means it doesn't matter with the YPT300 that the switch will not be accessible when mounted to the board.  Check your keyboard to verify this function and if it doesn't make this check, be sure the pedal mode switch is in the right position before gluing!"

I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... I'd have rated it 1 star, but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 (Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike) and it worked out ok. Still a tight fit though (since there's only 8\" of wire)...\n\nI'd recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.\n\nAlso, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but I hear a hiss when recording. Again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not (or my shotgun mic)."

As many musicians (and their parents) know, quality of the final product is most important and we are impressed.  He immediately started using it for auditions, online postings, and school work and we have been surprised at how well it records.  It is very user friendly and very durable (we all know how hard teenagers can be on things).  The mic also has its own carrying bag which makes it safe during transport to a variety of locations.

I had total faith she'd sound amazingly good, and as soon as I began to play I smiled big time. A 10\" speaker putting out virtually any tone with such clarity makes this a fantastic practice amp, and one could even gig with it in a small lounge type setting, perhaps run a line to the board.\nThe bottom line though is this is meant to be a practice amp, yet it has more clear output than you'll need.

This time, I saw 2 sm58's used for about what used singles were going for... top rated (1,000s of five star ratings seller) so I went for that.\nWellll, even if it's not \"too good to be true\" you can get scorched.\nTurns out the two came and were packed so it looked like it was used except... no wear on the mikes (first tip off, mine look like I drove roofing nails with them) plus the knockoffs sounded like junk and I can't hear.\nComparing it to a real Amazon purchased sm58, it was a darn good Chinese copy but the details (and sound) gave them away. You'll find what to look for online in YouTube Videos if you think you've been had.\nSo, my contribution to the accolades for the SM58 is to forget buying on auction sites as many other advise, way way too many SM58 $2.00 Chinese knock off fakes out there to even think about it. Buy it from an authorized retailer like Amazon.\nOh yea, the real Sure sm58 mike, great voice response, picks up and handles voices great, not too touchy about being a bit off center and rejected background noise very well.

While this unit may not be the absolute latest and greatest audio interface on the market it has pretty solid support and history.  I got mine about 8 months ago for ~$60 (i think there might have been a pricing mistake!).\n\nWorks well with Windows 7 32 and 64 bit OS.  My only minor gripe is that the minimum number of samples is 128, which makes for roughly a 7 ms total latency.  The built-in soundcard on my HP laptop works down to 64 samples (32 using Jack in Linux), BUT cannot touch the sound of the MobilePre.  Note - using Reaper permits using a WDM Kernel Streaming driver instead of ASIO, which allows a little better latency.  Still, sound travels roughly 1 foot each millisecond, so the total latency is like have an amp about 7 feet away, which is barely noticable.\n\nSolidly built, great for guitar.  The preamp section when using a dynamic mic is a bit noisy though.\n\nWould recommend to a friend."

        "reviewText": "This particular Audio Technica cartridge will suprisingly enough yield very crisp and clear audio quality. Bass response is tight but not overwhelming nor weak. The wonderful thing about this type of cartridge is that it's basically a plug and play set up (just have to tighten a screw to hold it in place with most P-mount systems). The elliptical stylus or tip is designed for better contact with the stereo groove walls in a record resulting in better frequency response and clarity. The user does not have to worry about how much stylus pressure,weight, or anti-skating to provide to get the most from this cartridge;that's the beauty of using this cartridge on a P-mount tonearm instead of as a standard one...This cartrdige will perform admirably when used for regular record listening conditions. This is not a DJ stylus to scratch with as you may damage the needle and the record (\"burn\"). Also, it is more suitable for playing any kind of music except classical or jazz where a high end audiophile cartridge/needle would be needed. Such a high end cartridge and needle would bring out extreme musical detail as well as the ambiance or \"air\" of the instruments. Also, that would allow for better stereo separation as well... This is only a better than average cartridge meaning that you will only get about maybe a little over a year's worth of use from it (if you played one or 2 records a day or every 2 days respectively). That is also the difference between a basic low priced cartridge/stylus versus an audiophile grade one (those can usually go for about 5 years---but you would be talking anywhere from hundreds to maybe thousands of dollars)."

        "reviewText": "Who says you have to spend an x amount of hundreds even thousands of dollars on a phono cartridge to listen to crisp and detailed vinyl/analog playback ? However, words like crisp and detailed are very meager adjectives to describe the musical sonic characteristics of this cartridge (true, the rest of your component system's own sound characteristics come into play, i.e; receiver,amp,pre-amp,turntable,speakers).If any part of your audio system does not have that \"synergy\", then you may notice either slight, miniscule shortcomings from the cartridge or system or both. For those with already a warm or neutral sounding system will be dramatically surprised and awestruck. For those who have just the opposite type of system and also may have an eq inline, you may want to adjust your treble settings. The AT 440ML is NOT a neutral or \"warm\" sounding cartridge---far from it. The upper mids and highs will possibly have your dog running out of the room. It's not bass shy either. Bass is firm  but never muddy or boomy. It reproduces the lows and highs very well. There are no punchy mids (though the mids are reproduced admirably but not accurately). Some critics have said this cartridge out of the box and installed properly is reminiscent of having an inline equalizer and it's frequency knob controls in the \"v\" formation. Stereo channel separation is probably the best these ears have heard over any other stereo cartridge I have had in the past (from the Grado Prestige Series to a couple of high-end Shure cartridges).There is definitely a 3-dimensional sonic imaging characteristic in the AT 440ML (especially noted with acoustic and jazz music). The Audio Technica beats most other hi end named brands to the punch with such wide stereo stage channel separation. I have closed my eyes with headphones on or with speakers and I always hear and experience the \"you are there\" feeling that makes me appreciate records much more than the cold 2-dimensional flat sound of audio cd's. Female vocals have a soft but clear presence. Male vocals are well reproduced. The micro-linear stylus reaches deep into the grooves without carving the vinyl (YES ! a wonderful light tracker that requires anywhere from .8 to 1.6 g of tracking force).This will cut down on the wear and tear of your vinyl collection as well as your cartridge/stylus...\n\nDoes this mean that the AT 440ML is PERFECT and that you have finally reached analog playback nirvana??? Well, that depends on different viewpoints. If you have bought cheap cartridges all your life in the $20 to $40 range, then this AT 440ML will be an audio revelation that will have you realize what you have been missing all this time. BUT, it's only a taste of the high end, audiophile analog world. If you have had other hi-end name brand cartridges (an experienced audiophile) and have paid more than what this cartridge is going for, then from a monetary stance you may have paid too much---that is IF the AT's sound rivals or is reminiscent of those pricier carts. On the other hand, if you prefer the warm, neutral sound to your liking, and possibly don't want to experience ear and mind fatigue from a bright cartridge then do not buy this cartridge. The AT 440 ML is a colored (soundwise) cartridge. You will only become ear fatigued if you are used to more neutral or warm cartridges (this is where you will need to adjust your treble settings). As with most cartridges, the AT 440 ML does require a little bit of \"breaking-in\" period (some say 30 hours to maybe 50---depending on your playback time habits). I have owned the AT 440ML for over a year now and it does get more looser or liquid-like, smooth and sweeter in sound(but not warm or dull) with no harsh or grainy sonic characteristics (sounds like I'm describing a fine liquor or malt shake).\n\nThe last glaring question (probably one of the most important) is whether or not this is an excellent tracker (and this is a two-fold question or concern). Are words beginning with s, t, p, and f accurately reproduced (sibilance)? Yes and no. That honorary distinction would be for the Shure V15VxMR cartridge (which is now out of production and was the last of a dying audiophile cartridge breed to be had for a reasonable price range). With the AT 440ML it's more hit than miss with sibilants. About 85% to 90% of the time \"spitty\" consonants are pronounced accurately with a slight edge or exaggeration. However, there have been a few of my clean records where the letter \"s\" cuts through with that static-like harshness more than once on any given side. One such record I have that proves this theory and shortcoming of this cartridge is  Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive swing jazz album (the letter s is tracked harshly with that annoying edgy sound). As for overall tracking quality of the music signal in general from beginning of groove to end, it has that inner groove distortion problem licked (this is where the AT 440ML shows off it's greatest audiophile strength). This is due to the linear contact stylus. Nothing MORE aggravating to a record listener than when a low budget or poorly produced cartridge, while it may sound clear and great in the first few tracks on a record side, but then as the needle goes towards the center, the last tracks suffer horribly (no matter how much anti-skate force you apply)! You will no longer have this problem with the AT 440ML; you will finally find out what you have been missing.\n\nKeep in mind that this deep-groove tracing microlinear stylus by design,in picking up such fine musical detail, will also pick up record surface noise and dirt;That's right, that snap,crackle, and pop from static,dirt, or lint. Majority of micro-linear cartridges will do that as opposed to conical or elliptical styli that sort of tend to almost try to soften,mask or even blend out surface record noise.  Conical or elliptical styli,with their larger \"footprint\" tip, will push dirt and other debris out of the way on the record's surface. They also do not reach deep into the groove and make that much of an accurate contact with the groove's wall as a microlinear stylus does. The microlinear stylus will reach deeper into the groove where there is more accumulated dirt or debris;it's a fact(being a light tracker however, this will not wear out your records as fast as a regular stylus cartrdige would). So, I also recommend using an anti-static brush on those not so pristine records. This is the only other area where maybe it's competitor ,the Shure M97xE cartridge, might come out a little ahead; Shures are well known and admired for their almost quiet record surface noise playback and background !\n\nThe bottom line, with both thumbs highly up, I absolutely recommend this fine cartridge. Period. Especially for a novice to the vinyl world or someone on a budget. I have found it difficult to listen to cd's or any digital musical format since owning this cartridge. In fact, I get bored with cd playback nowadays. There's just no musical \"involvement\".Don't be fooled by the simple black and lavender/purple? colored simple looking cartridge. It's what's on the inside of the body that really counts ! The AT 440ML possesses that bang for the buck quality that is hard to beat and will revitalize your long yearning for super (not perfect) audiophile listening and extract nuances and other fine qualities from your record collection !"

There may be some built in modeling of which is not disclosed.  It has that British Jangly distorted tone on the 2nd channel.  On  the clean channel,  using the gain upwards of 3/4 will give you the introduction of some distorted tones and mimicking a valve type amp.  I was overall impressed with how nice it does sound, so much so that I may get second one for another room, perhaps the red special edition at the same price or the version with the British flag in white.\n\nThe only negative was the lack of a reverb.  Even if they would have added a digital modeled reverb, it would have been a great add on, but this bare bones amp is probably light years ahead of the amp I started on with which was a small Transistor Sears amp in the mid to late 70's..\n\nAs far as recording goes, using an external Mic would be no problem.  Understand that the smaller an amp is, the close proximity of a Microphone will make it sound larger.  It's only in open air and further away that the sound of the smaller speaker will show it's tininess.  If you have this amp at or near ear level or pointed up towards you at about 4-5 feet away, it sounds like a larger amp.  Regardless, I was impressed.  Great value and I would say it's above a practice amp.  It would absolutely handle a recording job as well for a different type of tone."

This is a handy way to get two plugs to interface if you have the proper cables on hand.\n\nHaving 2 of these in your audio toolbox is a must these days if you encounter multiple types of audio connectors (RCA, TRS, TR, etc)"

        "reviewText": "I've used sennheiser \"big\" shotgun mics (needing 48V phantom power and XLR connections) that are in the $700 price range and I was pleasantly surprised that the ATR-55 gave reasonable performance for the price.  You don't compare it to a 2 foot long mic that costs 15x as much and is clearly for professional use.  It's meant for the home moviemaker who is unhappy with the builtin mic on their camcorder which has an external 1/8\" mono mic jack  -- yes, this is a MONO output so it will likely only appear on one of two channels if you put it in a stereo mic jack leaving the other one empty.  You might want to build or buy a dual mono to a single stereo adapter so you can capture audio from 2 mic sources on tape when using this.  It will give you more editing options later when you read your tape + 2 audio tracks into your software.\n\nWhat it does best is replace that built in microphone on your DV handheld recorder that picks up the motor noise and every click of the buttons you press.  It does tend to reject your voice if you whisper to the person next to you, perhaps to adjust the lighting.  The package comes with two mic holders, one for a hot-shoe (no electrical connections) and one for a traditional mic stand/arm.  AT made a complete kit out of this unit.\n\nIt uses a single AA battery which should last for a long time.  Some advice - toss the included battery in your pile and buy a good one that won't leak.  I recommend the L91 lithium AA batteries because of their long life and long storage without leakage.  This is a battery you won't be replacing for a couple years so it's best to put a high quality one in to begin with since you'll forget it.  The L91 also provides about 2x the usage of a normal alkaline battery, but it costs ~2x as much so it works out in the end as a wash.\n\nOne note - the picture shows a nice metal mini 1/8->1/4 adapter but what is included in the kit is plastic and lacks the screw-on threads to keep it from pulling out.  The cable is fixed to the microphone and not replacable like professional equipment, but again it's not at that price point.\n\nUse this and your videos will sound alot better.  The next step up is a wireless mic and receiver package for really long distances.  I have used several of these and they make for excellent tapes of a single subject willing to wear the mic and transmitter.  With the shotgun mic you are ready to go no matter who or what you are recording.\n\nI think you'll be impressed with what you get for your money here."

Using different types of cables had caused significant buzz coming out of the board's AUX (line-level) outputs. We had the same problem with a Canon XA10 in another venue, but had used a DI box to convert the TRS 1/4\" output to XLR while cutting the signal down to mic-level. However, the Panasonic doesn't have an XLR input, so we thought we would need this cable to go out of the DI box & into the camera. To our surprise, we could connect it to our mono output on the board (after cutting down the signal strength with a small knob next to it on the board) & run it directly to the camera without having issues. We don't have the flexibility of making a separate mix through one of the AUX outputs, but we also didn't have any AUX's to spare.\n\nIt's a long explanation, but hopefully it will help someone, whereas it took me many hours of searching online for an answer. i highly recommend this cable & will start using more HOSA's in the future!"

It's not going to pick up your pet house farting or the car driving past outside, but that's exactly why this is a good thing.  It boosts a fragile human voice into a strong one, if they make use of the proximity effect as a benefit, rather than a detriment, which is probably why Bono liked it, but since it's dynamic, you can get away with capturing sound in environments where a condenser mic would require sound proofing and special vibration isolating mic stands.  If you want to sound great over a PC in a noisy bar, on a noisy stage full of musicians, the proximity effect and cardioid pattern of this mic will make that happen, and it will do the same for getting a good recording in a room that isn't soundproof, with traffic outside, etc.  Is it the mic that's going to capture the sound of a spit bubble popping in your mouth or your sister's pet mouse farting? No.  Do you want it to be?  No."

My present setup is minimal: Strats or p90 guitars to Boss tuner->TC Helicon voice harmonizer->Cry Baby->Xotic SP Comp->Voodoo Labs Micro-vibe->Mad Professor-> Simble Overdrive->Xotic EP Booster->Boss DD6 Delay->Hotone little delay pedal (forgot name)->Vox Pathfinder.  It loves all of the time based pedals.  You really have to work and tweak the overdrive pedals to get it to work for you. I'm not a distortion guy. SRV, CCR, Hendrix, Trower, KWS covers etc. Beats lugging the real Fender amps and only I notice the difference in sound.  It sounds good enough for the small 100 people venues.

While it is possible to buy a $130 guitar that is o-kaaay, you still need a luthier to set it up.  In my opinion you get what you pay for and there is a reason that Martins and Gibsons cost over $2000 for a decent instrument.

So I was going to get one of each but decided to try the WHLB first.\n\nAfter putting several hours into practicing scratching and many more hours ripping and remastering my vinyl,  I'm pretty happy.  It sounds amazing and I'm not having any issues with jumping or skipping.\n\nI've read on other sites that the screw for setting the overhang is a soft tinned metal,  so take care not to over tighten it, I hear they are hard to find(?)  I would think any parts store tho would have something that would work.  Doesn't take much force to hold in place, I just snug it and I don't tighten it.  I've also read that they are fragile(?), but I have no experience with anything breaking, I've only had it a couple weeks.  Not sure what part of it would break tho due to any design flaw that I can see.\n\n[edit]\nThere's a Toolkit that comes with it, consisting of a stylus brush and a screwdriver for setting the overhang... the brush is ok but the screwdriver is not good, it doesn't fit the head of the screw properly.  You'll likely damage your screw if you use this thing, it will cam out and mangle.  I just compared my tips with the one they sent, the Shure driver is unmarked but it's actually a #00 and the screw itself is a #1.  Hope this helps someone!\n[endedit]\n\nIt looks awesome!  Especially with my white control vinyl.  I like the fact that the needle protector is so large, I don't feel like I'm going to hit the needle while putting it on.  I don't necessarily like the curved lifting arm tho, I feel like I have more control with a flat angular one.\n\nI'm loving it tho, I would buy it again."

The Hosa Premium midi cables have very thick, solid midi connectors that fit nicely into you midi ports and the cable will not easily come out inadvertantly. The rubber-like shielding around the cable itself makes it feel well protected and it won't kink. I use them in the studio but they would work well on stage.

The cable jacket is thick enough that it should be able to stand up to regular use.  The cables are thick and comfortably pliable without being wimpy.  Unless there's some hidden weakness that I can't spot from the outside I fully expect these to last me for decades."

However, at ~45 years old, most of it spent in a basement with a leaky window in the Northeast, the faders barely moved.  I looked at replacing them - not hard on old through-hole stuff like this, but I was a little concerned about finding the right part.  On a friend's recommendation I bought a can of this and put the TINIEST amount into the fader, moving it around.  The faders became fresh and movable, almost immediately! Some dead zones which had caused weird panning, and all the scratching, were instantly gone.  So - this stuff is fairly expensive for a can, but considering the amount of work it just prevented, this is a miraculous product."

It appears to be well constructed: solid tweed cover (Which I much prefer to the old rubber coating), longer rubber reinforcement jacket near the plugs than the other low-end guitar cables I've had, and a Velcro tie to keep the cable together when wound up is a nice touch.

One mic for my guitar and my voice. You don't have to stick this thing up to your mouth to be heard, even when whispering. Everything comes through loud and clear and so natural sounding. I play sitting on a stage stool with the mic a few inches in front of my strings, pointing at my face. It amazed me the first time I tried it. Still does. With the pop filter, I can hand-hold it as close to my mouth as I want, and no pop. I will probably still get the SM-58 one of these days, but don't need it with this one, just want it.\nIf you don't have one of these mics, just buy one, you'll love it. WARNING: Do Not buy a discounted SM-57 or SM-58 on ANY auction site, or anywhere for that matter. China is making very cheap imitations that are hard to tell from the real deal. Even the box is duplicated. You can find these fakes for 25 to 60 bucks. They are worth about 10. ONLY buy from a reliable source, like Amazon, they are an authorized dealer. This thing cost $100.00  ANYwhere.  If you are buying it for less, its probably a fake."

The SM58 is a bit dull, while the E835 really brightens your voice. Granted, I have a naturally lower timbre (baritone) in my voice, but even the tenors, altos and sopranos prefer the E835s (and some the OM2s) to the SM58.\n\nEither way, they're all great mics, it just comes down to personal preference usually. But if you like brighter tone with more natural character, I'd go with the E835."

        "reviewText": "This is a quick review - I hope to update this review later. Started looking at amps and was blown away by the sound of a VOX AC4TV (clean/warm tone). Almost ready to buy it, but then decided to see what else was out there. Began seriously considering the Fender Mustang series. Only problem is I really didn't want to keep toying with the computer to achieve the sound I knew I wanted - and I do like to tinker with settings. I also couldn't justify the great expense at this time (I think the mustang is shackled until you get the III with the interface). Kept digging a little more. How can I get the rich VOX sound I wanted? I also knew I just had to have a 12 inch speaker.. right? Wrong. My venue 99.9% of the time right now is my living room and bed room. I realized I would not be able to fully appreciate a 12 inch speaker until properly driven with 20-40 watts. I already knew the pawn shop 15w peavey rage I had could get really loud ... did I need really loud? Would that increase my amount of practice time? No - going back and reassessing... I wanted that VOX tone. Ok - but I had the VOX stomplab (see my other review... also soon to be updated), and it could make the VOX series of sounds... really nice through good headphones - I guess ok in the Peavey. Still fighting back discontent - what was it I was looking for??? Simplicity, tone, and price (and no concern for tube maintenance) - not necessarily in that order.\n\nI found the Pathfinder at a local shop (not my local GC). I took a couple minutes with the display model to see if I was achieving the warmth I was looking for. It took less time than I figured to decided that at this price, I would be satisfied. Did I side by side test the pathfinder with the mustang? not yet. Maybe I will one day.\n\nWhat am I doing more of than before with the Pathfinder? Practicing/playing.\n\nMy current setup is an Epiphone SG Pro with a VOX Stomplab IIG and now the Pathfinder.\nThe pathfinder adds enough of the warm VOX tone I was looking for with all knobs set at 12 o'clock and the channel set to clean. I can make adjustments to tone with the SG Pro's volume/tone knobs and coil tapping. I'm not looking for extreme sounds - so generally I use the Stomplab for some variety of reverb, delay, and/or chorus AND the pedal is a big plus for master volume control. If I want gain/overdrive/distortion - I leave the pathfinder alone. I rely on the stomplab for the gritty sound I want. It has a much better capacity to deliver in that arena.\n\nThis is my poor man's audio chain. The only thing I can improve at this time is my playing. If I am ever lucky enough to gig/play with others - and if the Pathfinder won't mike well - then I may consider something bigger/better. For now - big isn't everything for me. The Pathfinder has won me over.\n\nI'm only a couple days into playing with this setup and if I ever get tired of it or it stops working well for this beginner/intermediate - I will post otherwise."

Then again, it might not!)  And the 57 is a surprisingly good performer for vocals in the studio.  I like my large diaphragm condensers for some things, but when I want to wail, the 57 is still among the best I've found.  Maybe THE best.  The special Shure A2Ws windscreen is the reason for my new appreciation of the 57.  With the windscreen in place, breath noise and plosives are gone (unless I get really sloppy).  I a/b'd the 57 with the windscreen against a Shure SM58.  The 58's a great mic, but the 57 sounds more open in the top end (as other reviewers have noted.)  Generic windscreens don't sound as good with this mic.  They tend to be too thick and dense, blocking a lot of the high frequencies.  Spend the $15 and get the A2WS.  It has a set screw that enables you to lock the screen in place, leaving a small air space between the foam and the mic's grill.  Gives it a nice, open, airy sound.  The 57's not a high output mic, so you'll need a bit more gain in the preamp compared to some mics, but that's a very minor drawback.\n\nFor mic-ing guitar amp cabinets, this is an industry standard.  Also good for snares, toms, even kick drums.  (Take the windscreen off for these applications, of course.)  It's probably the most versatile microphone ever made.  At around $100, there is no better bargain."

I also attached a windscreen on it (also purchased from Amazon) and I've found that this mic is surprisingly capable as a vocal mic, too.  Don't be afraid to put this mic in front of very loud sound sources, like amps or snare drums.  It'll handle just about anything you throw at it.  If you're like me and have your own home studio, the SM 57 is absolutely essential.  I don't have too many mics, but the 57 has taken over about 95% of my recording tasks, even replacing my condenser mic for vocals.  I could not be happier with this mic."

        "reviewText": "I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!\n\nIncidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.\n\nEdit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-"

I play primarily through an American Deluxe Strat-HSS. My LP is too hot and sounds kind of like hot trash through it.\n\nFirst, what I would not do with this amp - \"gig\" with it. Play it out, play it live or with a drummer. It is a $70 - 10w solid state amp. You have to crank it to do those things and solid state amps just don't sound as good maxed as they do at mid levels. This amp sounds terrible with everything dimed. That doesn't mean you can't...and if your budget is only $70 for your amp, then do what you gotta do.\n\nWhat is has. Gain control & channel, volume, bass and treble. Using the gain channel as a distortion doesn't sound great to me. In fact it sounds like a can of bees. Not the good Cobain kind of bees; the, \"I think your amp is smokng, dude,\" kind of bees.\n\nHowever, using the gain control (not channel) and volume together creates a very full clean sound. Some of my pedals like clean boosts or clean drives don't really do much with the Pathfinder, but they are designed for tube amps and that is understandable (refer to above \"bee\" sounds for a better description). Also, analog delay doesn't sound great, but digital delays and light reverb are cool (of course).\n\nI use it for true bedroom practice. and just wanted something that I could run my pedal board into that had a little character. We also have had a Roland Microcube in the house, but it is very sterile sounding. The Vox actually carries that Vox tone and has a bit of warmth. I've also spent a lot of time on the AC4TV tube amp and that is much better, but also a lot louder and $300.\n\nI do knock of stars for the non existant gain and amps intolerance for effects. For the price, less than a cheap effect pedal or video game with some DLC, this is an awesome value and really good clean practice amp. Again, if you need to practice your Meshuggah riffs, you need to look elsewhere. A tiny bit of reverb and delay sounds really good and for open chording or practicing with your headphones on, this is a great investment."

Monster throws lots of techno-babble around about things like \"time correct windings\" but if the cable doesn't work it doesn't matter how good it is.  Their higher end products make more of a difference in sound quality than their entry level line.\n\nMonster makes three series of progressively more expensive microphone cables which are the 100 (this one), the 500 (BETTER) and 1000 (BEST.)  This \"100\" cable series is their \"entry level\" mic cable and their lightest weight XLR cable series with the smallest diameter cable.\n\nWhile the cable itself is small in diameter, the 100 series cable has big fat MOLDED-ON XLR connectors, the presence of which creates with two drawbacks.  First, if they break you can't fix them and you just have to cut them off and replace them.  Second, when you pull a Shure SM-57 or SM-58 size mic out of the stand adapter these fat molded connectors don't slide as smoothly through the stand adapter as a standard Switchcraft type connector would.\n\nWhen these connectors go bad, you could buy a new Switchcraft connector and solder it on which would void the warranty, but the cable is not user serviceable otherwise.  Since they have a \"LIFETIME\" warranty on all Monster products, instead of fixing it you can get it replaced free and I'm of the opinion that this warranty is why this cable costs about twice what it should. Plus you have to do without the cable for a while until you get the replacement.\n\nThere are a multitude of other manufacturers making good reliable mic cables and some have better material quality than the Monster 100. Aside from the Monster lifetime warranty you'd be just as well off with a quality cable from another quality line and in some cases better off.  Some of the other manufacturers also have a lifetime warranty.\n\nThe color coding was a nice idea, but from 30 feet away the tech won't be able to see the little colored insert stripe ring.  3-M Mystic tape is the time proven color coding material anyway.\n\nCables with these molded on type connectors would be more suitable for a permanent installation such as a church or meeting hall or infrequent use than for a band that plays a different room every night.  They are not as durable as one with standard Switchcraft or Neutrik XLR connectors.\n\nIf you must have a Monster mic cable and if you are going to be using the cable a lot, or using it in a critical situation I'd step up at least to the 500 series or try another reliable name brand like Planet Waves or the Horizon brand which are very well made.  I've also had good luck with the Shure brand cables which is a very economical solution.\n\nThere are also a number of small companies selling custom made Mogami or Canare mic cables.  Just do an internet search on Mogami mic cable.  In many recording studios you can usually find Mogami and/or Canare brand cables.\n\nI do use the pricier Monster instrument cables which are worth at least some of the extra money to me.  I own two of those and they have been good cables.  These Series 100 Microphone cables are better than nothing, but no cable is 100% failsafe so I'd keep a spare handy.  You are paying a premium price but don't expect cables that never fail."

        "reviewText": "No makers I know about are producing a turntable that has a P-Mount tone arm.  For legacy turntables that require a P-Mount/T4P cartridge along with a record collection in excellent condition your choices for something better than a \"starter\" cartridge in the $25 to $70 range continue to dwindle.  Many major cartridge makers have eliminated all but their lesser P-Mount cartridges while others like Ortofon stopped making any T4P (P-mount) cartridge at all.  The AT-311EP is possibly the best sounding P-Mount cartridge still widely available at a price that about anyone can afford.  This AT311EP is not the best T4P/P- Mount cartridge ever made or even the best one still available at any price but in the price range it performs way beyond the cost.  (If you have more money to spend the Grado Black T4P is $75 and the Gold Grado T4P is something over $200.  The AT311EP specs approach the Grado Black for way less money.)\n\nAudio-Technica actually recently listed this AT311EP as \"discontinued\" on their website, so I thought those in the supply chain were all there would be. The ATN3472SE replacement stylus is safe since the AT92ECD uses the same stylus and that cartridge was not discontinued.  Then came good news that for some unknown reason Audio-Technica changed their mind so the AT311EP webpage no longer carries the \"discontinued\" stamping as of 04/04/2015.  So the AT311EP has been snatched back from the jaws of death. Very unusual for a discontinued product to make a comeback, but I'm glad and it was a good save.\n\nThe AT311EP is better than even other AT cartridges that look cosmetically identical, such as the AT92ECD, which costs a few dollars less.  The others are cheaper but the extra few bucks for the AT311EP is a good investment. The first reason I say the AT311EP is better is the ATN3472SE stylus used on both the AT311EP and AT92ECD is elliptical (also known as bi-radial) and is not conical (also known as spherical.)  This particular stylus is very narrow so it goes deeper into the groove than other elliptical styli in the cartridge's price range. The difference seems to matter less sound wise with a 45, but with a 33 microgroove album in excellent condition the difference in higher frequencies is obvious.  The AT92ECD cartridge has nearly identical specs to the AT311EP in all regards except for a 30% lower output voltage of 3.5 mv instead of the robust 5.0 mv output on this AT311EP.  The higher output of the AT311EP translates to a stronger signal for an improved signal to noise ratio.  To me the significantly higher output voltage from the AT311EP is more than worth the few dollars difference.\n\nAs an alternative choice the Shure M92E is another widely available and popular P-Mount elliptical option and a fair value too.  Shure now calls the M92E stylus \"bi-radial\" yet suffix that model with an \"E\" which has almost always has meant there is an elliptical stylus in a Shure phono cartridge.\n\nThe second reason I say the AT311EP is maybe the best affordable P-Mount cartridge left is the overall specs compared to others in the price class.  In output voltage it equals the Shure M92E but surpasses it in almost every other category and it should since the Audio-Technica is slightly more expensive.  Of course specs can be manipulated to say whatever the manufacturer wants by leaving out things like + or - dB or the specific frequency of a measurement tone.  However in the case of the AT311EP the incredibly wide range of reproduction specified at 15-27,000 Hz clues you into it being a very bright cartridge that also has a big low end.  AT does not spec a dB plus or minus tolerance in their frequency response spec, but the AT311EP has a brighter and more airy character than the Shure M92E while being equally robust in output and it exceeds the Shure in channel separation and channel balance specs.  The airy tone in the AT311EP cartridge works great with clean records in excellent shape but it can get annoyingly noisy on worn bargain bin records.\n\nShould you ever choose the Shure M92E over the AT311EP?  Yes.  When you have records in only fair to good shape and they are not perfectly clean the Shure M92E would be a more prudent choice since it tames at least some of surface noise present in worn or dirty discs.  So when should you choose the AT311EP?  When you have clean records in excellent shape and a system capable of doing something with the extra high frequencies it can pass.  The Shure by virtue of it's less pronounced high frequency voicing will sound better with less apparent surface noise when playing noisy records. The Shure is also going to collect a bit less dust from deep in the grooves since it doesn't go as deep where the real trash collects.  I've noticed the slightly narrower stylus on the AT311EP tends to collect way more stuff from old neglected records because it goes deeper in grooves where dust is next to impossible to remove with traditional record cleaning pads and carbon fiber brushes.  I can't get to some of that dust and gunk on used records from a second-hand store by using a Discwasher pad cleaner but the AT311EP stylus sure can.  When you have an excellent to near mint clean groove you can turn the treble up and the AT will sound far more airy without surface noise or distortion.\n\nI think the low distortion on the highs is a real strong point of the AT311EP.  It isn't brittle, it is clean.  I put on a really good copy of a very good recording (\"What's New\" by Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle) and heard detail I frankly had never heard before with the Shure M92E.  On the other hand I put on a used bargain bin copy of an old Dells LP and even though I cleaned it best I could with the Discwasher and a carbon fiber brush the AT stylus collected so much stuff from deep in the groove I had to stop playing each side to clean off the dust clogged stylus and then resume play numerous times.\n\nBoth the AT311EP and Shure M92E are very light tracking cartridges with an optimum of 1 to 1.25 grams.  Neither should ever be used at more than 1.5 grams. The 1kH 29dB channel separation specs on the AT311EP are far better than the 1kH 20dB spec on the Shure M92E and darn close to the Grado Black's 30dB.  The channel balance specs on the AT311EP are slightly better than the M92E also, by 0.75 dB. The AT311EP uses a .1 mil narrower stylus so it goes a wee bit deeper into the groove than the Shure M92E which accounts for both some of the added brightness and turning it into a better dust collector on old neglected records.  The Shure has the advantage of a lower cost stylus replacement because the ATN3472SE stylus used in the AT311EP is harder to make since it is slightly narrower and because the AT's are imported from Japan.  Both the Shure and AT styli are diamond, thus about equally durable but the AT replacement is going to cost you more and stylus replacement cost matters to some people.  If you play a LOT of records or just like changing your stylus every few hundred hours then the Shure might be a money saver in the long run, but if you have a system capable of true fidelity the Shure simply is not as airy on the high end of the audio spectrum.\n\nIn an affordable P-Mount cartridge the AT311EP and the Shure M92E are the ones to consider right now for under $50.  Of the two the AT311EP sounds much better to me.  So P-Mount choices have narrowed dramatically in the past few years with most of the better P-Mount cartridges already gone and this midline AT311EP apparently barely escaping death. I love my old linear tracking turntable that uses P-Mount cartridges and this AT cartridge makes it sound way better to me. While it isn't the best in the world it beats the Shure in the high frequencies and for under $75 the AT311EP is the best P-Mount left that I know about.  I am perfectly happy with it when playing clean records in good shape but not as happy with older worn records.  This AT cartridge is not very forgiving at all.  Wear and scratches are going to be very apparent.  If it has a fault, it is clarity.\n\nIf you have a good stereo with a decent P-Mount turntable that tracks at 1.5 grams down to 1.0 gram with a record collection in above average shape this AT is possibly the best and brightest P-Mount elliptical cartridge left at under $70 for you.  If you have a system that doesn't pass much over 15k Hertz or records in less than ideal shape the Shure would be fine because you probably would not hear anything over 18k Hertz from your system anyway.\n\nEven though this AT311EP, the Shure M92E plus other AT cartridges are touted as \"Universal Mount\" and come with components included to adapt them to a traditional half-inch headshell mount, I would never suggest any P-Mount (T4P) cartridge for anything but a P-Mount tonearm.  There are better half-inch cartridges available for around the same money or just a bit more that are easier to setup on a half-inch mount headshell. The adapter components included with the \"universal\" cartridges add weight that frequently is hard to compensate for to get the tracking down to the 1.5 gram maximum and also add height that can cause setup complications such as an off tracking angle requiring shimming of the front mounting of the cartridge plus there can be azimuth angle compensation issues.  Mounting a half-inch cartridge is hard enough, don't make it harder by using a \"universal\" mount cartridge.\n\nThe lone surviving Shure P-Mount cartridge is a fair cartridge and I've used it before, but it is not as airy as the AT311EP.  I gave the AT311EP 5 stars because while there were better P-Mount cartridges available at a sane price there now are not any better ones.  So a 4 star cartridge by default becomes 5 star in absence of the better models that are gone. The next step up is the Grado Black and for the casual non-audiophile listener like me with consumer grade components, while very nice, a Grado would be overkill.  The AT311EP is a steal right now costing less than dinner and a movie.  Unless you spend $75 you just can't do any better in a P-Mount than this."

        "reviewText": "Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a \"Shure Model 545 Unidyne III.\"  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function.  I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's.  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.  You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen."

It is no longer the audiphile steal of the decade, and thus needs to be juxtaposed to its competition.\n\nFurthermore, it requires a very low mass tonearm to get the right resonance synergy due to the very high compliance and low downforce.  All Technics and most Rega arms, for instance, are mid-mass.\n\nFor a hundred bucks a replacement tip nowadays, you might as well get into mid-compliance moving coil designs, which by their very nature have extremely low effective tip mass due to there being only coils rather than heavier magnets on the cantilever end on the other side of the pivot inside.  You can't replace the stylus yourself on an MC, but you're practically paying the cost of a whole new cart on the 440MLa anyway at these prices.\n\nAs was also proven with the Shure V15 series before it, the diamond cut and cantilever material can be instrumental in giving a moving magnet/moving iron design low effective tip mass, but there is a diminishing return.  MC designs with such improvements are even lower tip mass.  If the price ever comes back down on the replacement tips to a reasonable price, then certainly snatch them up.  It's an incredible MM design."

On top of that I have also done work as a mobile DJ and have used various microphones, so I do know what I am talking about when I say that, even for the price, there are better options on the market.\n\nInitially, I started using my own Shure PG48 (not the SM58) in place of one of the R21's that had been used for vocals, switching it over instead to amplify an acoustic guitar. The R21 did well when it came to amplifying acoustic instruments, so I was able to find a use for them, while using my entry-level Shure for vocals and just regular speaking, which that handled a lot better.\n\nThen, when I purchased a portable Behringer sound system, their XM1800S microphone came with it, so I was introduced to that. The XM1800S also comes in a three pack that's about $5 less, but it gets compared to the Shure SM58, with some professionals preferring it to the standard Shure microphone. So, I ordered the three pack of XM1800S, and am keeping the Samson R21's strictly as instrument microphones.\n\nI want to end this review by saying I don't hate the Samson R21 mics. They just weren't cutting it on vocals, but they have done well when it comes to instruments. As anything, it really depends on what you're using it for, but if you take my advice, use the R21 for instruments, use the Behringer XM1800S for vocals and save yourself $5. You'll be happy you did."

So while I didn't purchase it, it's been in my possession for the last three years, and it's been in use on a fairly consistent basis since.\n\nFirst of all, it is a Shure microphone. While technology is quickly closing the gap between inexpensive and expensive equipment, the one thing I can say about this microphone that I can't say about many (not all) other low-cost dynamic microphones is that it feels solid when it's held. If it falls to the floor I don't have to worry about it being damaged. Any Shure I've ever used has felt the same way.\n\nSecond, it is an entry level microphone. Don't expect the PG48 XLR to perform like Shure's more famous SM57 or SM58. While they may be the same brand, they certainly are not the same microphones. Shure is clear in their product description that the best uses for the PG48 XLR are for public address and karaoke performances. In my experience I've found this description to be accurate.\n\nThird, if you are looking for performance microphones at a low-cost, there are a couple I could easily recommend that, while they aren't Shure, will more than get the job done. As I mentioned previously technology is quickly closing the gap between brands like Shure to brands like Behringer. Since this is a review about the Shure PG48 XLR though, just ask me for my recommendations in the comment section.\n\nThe last thing I'll say is the PG48 XLR is a good entry level microphone regardless of who makes it. Given its proper setting and application it's more than adequate to make public announcements or to sing to a group of 50 or less. In such settings there's no need to go the more expensive route, even within the Shure family. Just don't expect to be able to play in a rock band with it, because it's not that kind of microphone."

I use Augustine classical guitar strings, I also use Pro Arte (Normal Tension EJ45C) classical guitar strings which sound really good (highly recommended). For those who are first time guitar buyers...NEVER put steel strings on a classical guitar because the neck is not strong enough and it will bend or snap. Classical guitar strings are nylon.

Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.\n\nThe first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then I changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.\n\nHere's what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.\n\nI haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.\n\nI looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10K Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.\n\nI also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.\n\nI then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.\n\nI didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but I did reach some conclusions:\nThere is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.\n\nI wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58."

While it is not the \"ideal\" microphone for all applications, it is very good, very reliable, has good vocal qualities, and though other similar microphones may be \"just as good,\" the comparison is always \"compared to the SM58.\"\nYou can't go wrong with choosing these as on stage vocal microphones. I have 3 of these and 3 PG58 for back up or for miking amplifiers or instruments. The on-off switch is a good feature so noise won't go through when you don't want it to (during breaks, when talking to band members, etc.)"

My set up for this job is a Denon DP-45f turntable running straight through an amazing 1975 vintage Marantz 3600 preamp that's been completely refurbished to original specs, then to the ProTools inputs with custom made Mogami cables by ProLA Audio. My previous (other) cartridge is a Denon DL110 high output moving coil (also purchased a few months ago for this labor of love)\n\nAfter a careful set up using the Hi Fi News test record, where this cartridge tracked noticably better than the Denon, after about a dozen LP's tracking at 1.7 grams (tho 1.4 is suggested, 1.8 is the max and this tested best for my set up), my observations are (positives 1st):\n\n1) This cartridge has noticably, and I mean NOTICABLY, better tracking ability. Inner groove distortion is all but eliminated on records that I had deemed un-rippable with the Denon cartridge.\n\n2) Surface noise is also noticably lower (over 7db measured through ProTools in A/B recordings of the same record passages between tracks). Pops and clicks are also diminished greatly-as a guestimate I'd say over a third to almost half, but that is truly subjective based on the damage done by previous playings on my particular used records.\n\nThe negatives (in relation to my other set up)\n\n1) The AT cartridge doesn't sound as good as the Denon on prime vinyl. It has a smaller soundstage (less \"open air\" around the instruments). Also, The highs have a decidedly more metallic sound on cymbals and hi-hats, etc. Silibance issues are also more pronounced-not totally harsh but again more prominent than the Denon, which when the vinyl is worthy is a joyous listening experience. I'm sure this will lessen on the AT as I get another 50 hours or so on the cartridge, and even when the silibance is more pronounced there's no truly annoying inner groove distortion to go with it.\n\n2) The AT cartridge is 50% more than the Denon.\n\nBut, to all but eliminate the nagging issue of having to buy 2 copies (or more) of certain records and even then, more often than not, not completely solving the IGD problem, I surely would have saved the price of the AT cartridge considering the 150 LP's and counting I've done so far. The combination of the two cartridges for me solves an issue that was hindering the amazing amount of fun I've been having ever since I realized I've been lied to all along when they told me digital was better :-)\n\nMy only other \"issue\" is not with the cartridge, but with Amazon. They've been getting slack on \"fulfilling\" Prime orders when the item is from a third party vendor but \"in stock\". I had to again call customer service when this item didn't show up as promised. (the second time in three months). The person was very friendly, saying there was an internal error with the processing. When I ordered a second one overnight just to make sure I'd get one in time for my listening party, she waved the additional shipping and Ok'd the return while I was on the phone-a nice gesture even if it is a mute one with the full refund upon return. They both showed up the next day.\n\nWith ALL that said, this is a great solution that I can not be happier that I discovered by research and reading other reviews on Amazon. I hope mine helps you make your choice-you won't be disappointed. 5-stars!"

Heavy weight and good padding on the bottom make this very stable for live performance. Mine have held up fine through numerous shows with no issues whatsoever.  A really nice feature is that they have a built-in physical connecting plate on the bottom that lets you join these physically together in gangs.\n\nSome people might not like the heavy weight, but I love the heft.  No accidental kicking it around with stage antics, and built like a tank."

I have had no real issues with mine, but do want to note my one reservation about the cable: the end connectors come loose rather easily, and I strongly recommend that you check that they're tight before playing. Though few professionals would choose this cable, it's totally adequate for my purposes practicing at home with a small amp. For the cost the looks can't be beat and it does come with a limited lifetime warrantee from Fender."

I am so glad I did.\n\nI compared this cable model to the more expensive models I previously purchased and, aside from looks, could not detect any difference in sound. I Swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards, ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference.\n\nWhat the more expensive model has going for it is looks. I am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.\n\nBottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision. You may find, as I did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer."

Since I have three of those units daisychained I was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter.\n\nAnother reason why I love this is it's noise free. In some environments in which I play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit. I have not had that problem with this one, so it's another plus.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case I damage or lose my primary one.

They are also ideal if you are hosting jams and open mic nights and want reasonably reliable microphones that don't cost a fortune - but get the job done.\n\nWhat I love is the price and value. You get three instruments that may not be SM58s, but they are not terribly far off.

In other words, they are inexpensive, but not cheap.\n\nYou can also use these to mic amps. Placing these 6\" from speakers (or bass drums or toms) captures a lot of low end. Move them back a foot or so and you get a more natural sound with a nice balance of highs, mids and lows.\n\nFinally, if you are starting up as a band on a budget, these and the dual channel pre-amp may be all the microphones you need for some time. In fact, you may be satisfied and not want to upgrade as you get more successful. But if you do, these can be relegated to the role of spares and you will continue to get value from them that way."

I can see the complaints for the sounds being listed as different genres (no death metal polka?), but that really means nothing in the scheme of things. If anything it will have you going to certain ones (retro) more often cause of the sounds there (retro), though I don't have any favorites cause I love (retro) all my kids (retro) the same.\n\nmoving around to adjust the sound can be a little tricky at first, the sounds out of the box are pretty much what you are looking for, then using the 4 knob classic control (sustain/decay, attack, filter, cutoff) is usually enough, but we all want more kontrol, and you get that with this. this is a perfect price as well, being just enough that you know you're getting quality, and not so steep that it's not affordable.\n\nback to the device, the sounds are as analogee as you could hope for, the tones when dropped an octave, are so thick, dense and awesome, that it is just amazing. there are some really nice sounds out of the box that are impressive, with a couple that are surprising and enjoyable, like a whistle kind of sound and other chirpy sounds that are, as my sister and I say...the future, as imagined in 1972!!!! that said, this thing will probably be what most people looking to make their own electronic music, indie/diy stuff, and anything in between. I am a big fan of tangerine dream, the blade runner soundtrack, as well as other vangelis albums, so there is some stuff in here that gets me to where I want to go. I just got it, but the more I tinker, the more I am happy with what sounds and tones I find.\n\nI wanted to end this on the controversy of the mini-keys. I at first didn't mind the idea, seeing as how, as they say in videos \"you use one hand on the keys, the other one twiddling knobs\". then as I actually got it and started playing, I realized something better that I haven't seen mentioned yet, though I didn't read all the reviews here, but it's safe to say NO ONE ELSE HAS SAID THIS, so gather round, make some s'mores, get your camo-snuggie on. the smaller keys works wonders for playing EXTENDED chords, so, to try to be clear and helpful, you start on one key, then, say, the next key you hit is 3 away from that one, usually chords only go like another 2 or 3 keys from that one, these little keys let you really stretch and easily make up chords that wouldn't be possible on a full sized keyboard, or if they did, you would have to use both hands, or overdub. does that make sense? trick question, it does, press rewind if I haven't...well you get it.\n\nso the smaller keys actually is awesome, especially for electronic forms of music, where the chords used can be stranger than regular chords played on the piano. once I figured that out, this device became something more special than it already was.\n\nwhat? what's that? vocoder? yeah, it's awesome. don't want to call it novelty, but it would be something tough to use all the time, especially recording and having every song with it on there, but it's here, it works, and it works well. will use more in time, for sure, will probably write whole songs with it, lol.\n\nI got the vintage gold, which is the winner hands down! but this model has the most reviews, so I wanted to be included in this one. I have an inexpensive keyboard that has more \"normal\" sounds. this, with a keyboard with a HALF DECENT piano sound, and you can do something special. that with my guitar, bass, drum machine, sp-303 that I never use, and digitech jamman solo, and my effects pedals is enough to do some beautiful things."

Never did I have a single complaint about it. And I had it with me everywhere I went until I was almost 40 years old.\n\nMy son was an avid electric guitar player who wanted to give acoustic a try. Since I didn't have time to play my guitar during that time of my life I LENT my guitar to him. When I eventually had more free time and wanted to get back into my music I asked my son to please return my guitar, the one I let him BORROW. It was at that time he informed me that he SOLD it to a buddy when he needed money buy a Fender bass. Kids...\n\nSo...I bought this one and am very happy to have a Yamaha Classical Guitar back in my possession. The only differences I can see between my old one and this one are the colors and design around the sound hole and the absence of Yamaha on the headstock. To be sure this was the brand of classical guitar I wanted, I tried several different brands and models available on Amazon.com at local guitar stores.\n\nEvery other brand of classical guitar, regardless of the price, did not hold up to the sound of the Yamaha guitars. I'm not saying the other brands did not sound good. What I'm saying is the Yamahas sounded great. Should I ever decide to upgrade to a better classical guitar, I will stay with Yamaha.\n\nI could not find a lower price for this model than the Amazon.com price...anywhere. Having the Free Shipping option was a major plus.\n\nThere is only one reason I needed to call the Yamaha Customer Support Line. I needed to ask where the serial number is located. I couldn't find it to save my life. On the C40, look inside the sound hole to the inside edge of the fretboard.\n\nMy guitar was wrapped very well for shipping. It came with \"The Yamaha Guitar Quickstart DVD.\" The DVD has some very useful information to help you get started if you have no idea what to do with your guitar once you take it out of the box. A \"Welcome\" sheet with some good basics for beginners was also included.\n\nIt is so good to have another Yamaha Classsical Guitar back in my life."

The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better.

Biggest drawback is the very limited range and the vulnerability to radio interference.  If you keep the transmitter and receiver close (30' or less), and are considerate about placement, they work well enough.  We were using this for an outdoor commercial shoot, into a Zoom audio recorder.  We found that if the receiver was too close to the Zoom, it picked up lots of interference.  The solution was to keep the receiver at least several feet away from the Zoom.  It's also worth mentioning that these units will eat up 9v batteries rather quick.  Figure about 5-6 hours of usefulness on a battery.  There are better wireless lavs out there, but they cost a lot more."

I'm using a Wah, 3 dirt pedals, and a multi effects in the loop of my amp.

I can play many many songs with just these few simple chords and that is why I purchased it and I was hoping my child would see the ease and give it a try, I hope they do. this is a good learning tool for novice players that allow them to play songs in just a few moments, something very few systems do. Many get fustrated tring to play, this item takes away allot of that fustration in learning hand positions and allows them to play a song immediately. Great product for the novice, and the intermediate player and some older players with age may find this simple solution of tired hands easy to compensate for that problem and still play.( one thing I must mention, do not let this be a crutch for learning the correct chords and finger positions. It is so easy it will distract that fact from your learning and make it easy to push one button instead of learning the fingering and you will rely on it to much,Please learn from it and don't rely on it all the time) Still a great product and will indeed help you to learn the finger positions one chord at a time."

The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say, half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though, the signal is to hot, the music is crap, or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time. This product has improved my productions beyond it's price sold. I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJ's wireless systems to my own audio recorder. They work perfectly and haven't failed me once."

Some of the guitar amps sound pretty good, some I don't care for, for example the \"58 tweed B-man\" is supposed to sound like a 59 Fender Bassman. I own a 59 fender bassman and the software amp model doesn't do the original any justice. I did add the fx and bass packs and have not regretted the additional purchase. The bass pack is very useful.\n\nThe amp, cabinet, enclosure, microphone, and fx models do a good job recreating the originals with some exceptions. For $100 dollars and a project studio this software is hard to beat. It has helped me numerous times when I wanted a certain sound for a song and can't spend $$$ for a Marshall jcm 2000, mesa boogie dual rectifier, soldano slo 100, or a plethora of microphones. Also the pre-sets are good. Line 6 did an excellent job of recreating Eddie Van Halen's sound from the early 80's. But you can choose your amp, cainet, enclosure, mic, and fx combo and dial in your own settings specifically tailored to your desires quite easily. I did purchase the expansion Bass and FX packs. The bass cabinets and amps are very nice and the extra effects add quite a bit of room to create.\n\nI use this software on a PC running XP media center. I never had any problems installing, running, or updating the software. The only issue I've ever had with the software was a few years ago. I would plug in to play and all I would get was pure digital distortion every time I strummed my guitar strings. I did some research and discovered that there is a common issue with Guitar Port and my pc xbox 360 game controller working together. For some reason the software from the xbox controller interfered with the software from the guitar port. Before I installed the xbox controller the guitar port worked fine. So I uninstalled the xbox controller and now everything works fine again. This was about two years ago and I haven't looked to see if Line 6 or Microsoft ever resolved the issue, but I leave the game playing to my xbox 360 now and the recording, mixing, and editing to my pc.\n\nI do recommend this product for recording studios. It has helped me achieve sounds that I otherwise would have had to spend thousands of dollars on microphones and amps to achieve."

I hate to decrease my star rating, but it's obviously a low quality instrument and the Hola! uke is light years better sounding and looking.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hola-HM-121MG-Deluxe-Soprano-Ukulele-Mahogany-Binding-and-Aquila-Strings/dp/B00ATABRJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hola! HM-121MG+ Deluxe Soprano Ukulele, Mahogany + Binding and Aquila Strings</a>Don't let this review stop you from picking up ukulele! This kit got me going, so it was worth the money, even if Amazon hadn't refunded me!\n\nI'm a woodwind girl, but wanted something to take camping for around the campfire. Ordered this because it was a kit and on price point alone.  For the price paid, this has given me a lifelong hobby and a way to connect with my kids. Huge value.\n\nThe bag is pretty useless. It's thin and crinkly with no protective qualities, really. I suppose it would protect from sunlight and dust.  The cd and DVD are good, but I have gotten much more use out of youtube tutorials!  However, having the chords there in the book are nice, and does provide some basic musical notation info.\n\nThe instrument is obviously a \"starter\" uke. It's light and the finish isn't beautiful, but it doesn't look like a toy, either. The matte finish does attract fingerprints and is very plain. I bought some rub on transfers to personalize and decorate, which made me happier.  The strings do have to be tuned frequently, but I expected that from the reviews. After three weeks of daily playing they tune easier and stay tuned longer but still need tuning before each session. I bought  the Hola! Electronic tuner and just leave it clipped on. Works beautifully.  I think the sound is pretty and it seems reasonably well made for the price. I'm sure I will trade up in a year or two, but this is a great starter.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone wanting to give ukulele a whirl. It's a fast learning curve, and super fun!"

Fast forward a couple of months, the neck has developed a convex bow making it completely unplayable. I've taken it to a guitar technician for inspection and he declared it is unrepairable due to the neck bow, and it is a manufacturer defect.\nAmazon is usually good about returning defective items for me, but in this case the response was \"out of warranty\" and I'm just left with a worthless guitar that I paid $145 for.\nShame on Amazon, I've done a lot of business with them and this is not acceptable to me or anyone that works hard for their money.\nI'm disappointed and understandably frustrated, and my granddaughter can't continue with her lessons.."

Once the uke got tuned which takes about 2-3 days with the string stretch, it plays well and sounds good.\nIt's fit and finish isn't the best, and the sound is marginal, but overall it's a real decent value. Later when I have achieved more experience and talent, I can upgrade. I have paid so little for this setup, that it is easy for me to pass it along to someone else that wants to learn the Uke and there is no real financial loss.\nHint-Get the Snark SN-6 Ukulele Tuner. It is small and accurate, and makes Tuning a breeze.. which you will be doing a lot of the first few days. If it don't sound right to me, I just check it with the Snark. KEEP THIS FOR THE NEXT UPGRADE\n\nYou can put better sounding strings on this unit and it sounds better. But for learning the Uke.. it really can't be beat. I'd give it 5 stars if it were a better quality Uke... Plus it's a unit that can go on the road in a pack on a motorcycle, to the college dorm, and there is no worries your risking damage to an expensive unit. It's a perfect learning instrument. Then you can do with it what you want once your ready to upgrade... give it to a niece or nephew, grand child... send it off to college, you name it.. it will always be worth what you paid for it....\nI have no negitives.. it is what it is... designed to be a starter Ukulele, and it preforms that task with class... I am not afraid to show or let pro's play it and look at it.. they are also impressed with its quality at the cost. I used lemon oil on it and hand rubbed it out to a dull luster, and put better strings on it.. so with that.. it is impressive for the cost.\nThere are better Uke's on the market... those are for pro's. This is a starter unit."

I feel like a kid on Christmas morning every time I turn it on!\n\nLet's start by saying the MK kicks proverbial butt and then discuss the few things some people complain about.\n\n1. Mini keys: I started out as a guitarist, making lots of very small movements to play my instruments, so mini keys are fine. Pianists don't like them. But then, I don't like piano keys; they're like using a sledge hammer to drive a thumbtack. I have some full-size keyboards and I can't play those monster keys as deftly as I can play the short-travel minis on the MK. And if you want big keys, just midi any big keyboard to the MK. Problem solved.\n\nWell, that just about wraps up the complaint department.\n\nThe MK is a lap-size portable with the sonic power of a room full of vintage equipment. There are other synths in its size and price range but I don't think they sound better (personal preference) and they're not as easy to program. If I could have only one synth it would be a Microkorg.\n\nIn 2012, just to see if I could, I did everything on the MK. You can hear all my 2012 tunes at aejotz.com. Some of the sounds are presets, some are tweaked presets, some are patches I found online and some I programmed from scratch. I used no effects and the only non-MK sound you'll hear is the metronome click from my recorder, which I decided to leave on a couple of tracks. Long story short, I really put that \"toy\" through its paces.\n\n(The tracks from 1983 are all Casio MT-65. The tracks from 2011 and 2013 can be any mixture of Microkorg, Casio CZ-101, Alesis Micron, Arturia Minibrute, Yamaha PSR-520 and a few other gadgets.)"

Rather than just giftwrapping the box, I took the uke out, tuned it, retuned it, stretched the strings, retuned it.  After 2 days, it would hold tune for about 3 minutes of playing (junk strings are probably to blame).  I did all this because my neice would be a beginner and therefore be easily frustrated by an instrument that would not hold tune.  Next I went to a \"learn to play\" site on the net and found C Am F G7 chord diagrams and started to attempt to play.  The strings were so high off the fretboard that any note fingered above the 3rd fret would pull the string out of tune.  The easy chords were difficult because the high strings got in the way of my fingers so that I could not finger a chord cleanly.\n\nWith the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable.  In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords.  It sounded and played great!  I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one.  He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument.  Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from  Kala or Lanakai.  It played like the more expensive one, but didn't have the pretty binding, etc.  I loved it and bought it.  When I got home I called for an RMA and will send the much inferior Firebrand uke with all the books and cd's back to the seller.  The sellers were nice and seemed concerned about selling an unplayable instrument.  It's too close to Christmas to waste time on this one.  Hope this helps you out."

The size is just right and she doesn't feel overwhelmed like she did with the full-sized guitar.  She loves it and hasn't been able to put it down.  It's perfect for lessons, is easy to tune and sounds really good and rich despite the size.  Good things do come in small packages.  when she outgrows it in a couple years, I'll pass it down or trade it in for a larger model, but for now, it's perfect.  She's already mastered several chords on her own and she's about to start formalized lessons.  Great guitar for small learners to help them not feel so intimidated like they might with a full-sized guitar."

They are all good, but for me, these QScs are simply the best for sound quality/clarity, loudness and integrated power (500W per driver = 1000W per cabinet). When you then further consider the portability, functionality and performance, they are fully worth their premium price tag. I was initially sceptical about the high price, having bought them after all my others, and for more money, but I now think they may well have been my best-value purchase of the lot. I certainly use them more than all the others for convenience including outside jobs with potentially suspect weather (I got the matching outdoor speaker covers and so they can play on their stands outdoors in light rain). I remember at an outdoor gig once, the wind blew my projector screen unto my K10 speaker and stand, so that the K10 fell about 7ft to the hard asphalt ground. It suffered a small dent on the front grill (was in the cover), but did not skip a beat and kept right on playing through the incident, and have continued on with no problems ever since\n\nAll in all, a really fine powered pro speaker. You can get many alternatives for much less, but I think this is really outstanding value for money"

I've found a way around it. I rotated the pedal 180 deg, so that when I press with my toes - it gets more quiet, and when I press with the heel - more loud. This way I avoid this awkward foot position when it's fully muted. It only took about 10min to switch my brain and use it in reverse. And I'm not changing back - it works and it's very comfy."

You see these things pop up everywhere, from studios to live gigs to concerts on TV. They are everywhere. Which I find a bit strange because, frankly, they aren't that good.\n\nThe design of these mics goes back about 40 years. But a lot has happened with microphone technology during that time. These models may have been very good decades ago, but they are really showing their age. The most prominent problem with them is the sound quality... they are quite \"honky,\" making vocalists sound much more nasal than they really are. There are some situations where that might be okay (such as miking a guitar cabinet that lacks upper mid-range), but these models do not make good vocal mics.\n\nIn a shootout in my studio with more than 20 different models of mics, the SM57/58 were near the bottom of the list. Virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better. And I'm not talking about comparing it to $3500 Neumann U87 mics either... more than half of the mics we used were under $150. Other, better choices in a similar price range are the AKG D5, Heil Sound PR 22, or stepping up to the Shure Beta 57, which is much, much better. And all of which have better off-axis rejection and higher gain before feedback.\n\nI know that nearly everyone uses these mics, but that doesn't actually mean they are that good. There are much better choices for your money.\n\nOn the plus side, both the SM57 and SM58 are nearly bullet-proof. You can really abuse them and they'll sound just like they did when they were brand-new."

I mainly use it plugged into a laptop with an external soundcard or directly into a mixing board.\n\nIt picks up sound from a small or mid sized room nicely for acoustic performances.

With a super-wide 90 degree dispersion angle, sound fills out the space up close within a few feet, depending on placement (I prefer getting them up as high as possible on stands and using the clever 7.5 degree tilt function). The dispersion angle is also matched between the woofer and tweeter so you're never hearing just one or the other. 90 degrees is ideal for tight performance areas where you want people right in front of you to hear everything.\n\nThe trade-off here is that levels decrease quickly as you step back from the speakers. You can hear a significant difference as you get more than twenty or thirty feet away. While that could be seen as a negative especially for public address applications, I find it to be a win-win.  It essentially creates a \"full sound\" zone around the stage for the audience. I personally prefer creating a live music environment where people can hear a loud, full spectrum mix if they like but not have it forced on them wherever they are in the room. If your needs call for a speaker with more reach, the K12s (I've used them) throw a lot further and sound awesome as well.\n\nSpeaking of sound quality, I will say that while I think the K10 kicks the competition's a** throughout the EQ, it is especially spectacular in the mids and highs. Just playing an iPod through them, you will hear separated parts of the music in this range that you never did before. As far as your perfomances go, vocals and guitars will sparkle in a way you probably haven't heard out of a small cabinet.\n\nI don't want to downplay the bass response on these though. It is huge and far more than you would expect out of these little guys. The frequency coverage is absolutely there and can even be boosted if you utilize the DEEP switch. What you will NOT hear in the lower registers however is a ton of attack. They are more suited to adequately express a jazzy upright bass than they are to throw down the punch you want to hear from electronica or hip-hop (unless we're talking smaller spaces, they'll ROCK a house party DJs). Impressive but you'll find no magic here, that's why they make the Ksub.\n\nProspective buyers should also know that the 1 KW amp in these is Class D. That's not equivalent to 1000 watts in Class A for example. It's more than sufficient though and Class D amps are great for their light weight and power efficiency. I plug mine into a surge protector that powers a bunch of other devices simultaneously and have never had an issue.\n\nSignal routing is wildly flexible with the fantastic panel on the back. You can do whatever you want with these including play a small gig with one speaker alone. Just plug a mic, an instrument, and an iPod directly in.\n\nErgonomics are well done too. Knobs and switches are not fancy but easy to operate. There's also super sturdy, comfy handles on the top and on one side. Carrying two at once is easy (32 lbs. each) and saves you a trip back to the car.\n\nThe build quality is solid. I've always been careful with them but not used cases or bags and the only damage thus far has been cosmetic. The sides will scuff up pretty easily so use the duffels if thats important to you.\n\nI have not observed any malfunction up to this point other than some buzzing from the monitor once when it got rained on. After drying out, it didn't happen again. QSC has also put some serious limiting circuitry into these as well to protect themselves from blowing. I have more than once pushed my monitor too hard and reached this threshold. The signal simply cuts out when the the speaker cone experiences too much travel. Once you readjust the levels, you're back in business with no issue.\n\nI can't think of much to gripe about, the whole K series was very well thought out. I would love to incorporate a Ksub at some point as the crossover function is built into the entire line. These speakers aren't cheap at $700 a piece but you'll be paying for quality and design that cannot be found elsewhere."

In the same way as all we, people, have the same hands, legs and heads but have different nature and voices, the guitars, even of the same model of the same manufacturer may differ wildly.\n\nThe Classical guitar has to be made of wood. And wood, even of the same age and tree has much of personality and much of \"specifics in sound.\n\nIf you consider this guitar you are shopping in the lowest end for cheap instrument. Well do not do it! Because I doubt you will learn it ever.\n\nFirst of all buy the real Spanish guitar. I mean Spanish made in Span not the \"Spanish\" made in China or anywhere else. Spanish guitars, even the cheapest made toward sound, not toward look. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, it will sound as a toilet sitting and you never will be able to get decent sound out of it. The quality of sound is very important while playing classical guitar and you produce the sound with your hands. It is crucially important to learn to produce right sound by positioning fingers and nails properly: you will never learn it with cheap, not authentic guitar, because it will sound the same whatever you will try! It is like a car that make only left turn. Then you will try to play the real guitar not the bogus one , you will find youself incapable to make it sound as other players do.\n\nDo not try to choose guitar yourself because you can't produce any reasonable judgment until you will learn how to make it sound properly, you must take someone who actually knows how to play classical guitar. You have to get  a decent instrument because you MUST fall in love with the sound of one, otherwise it is pointless: you play guitar because it fascinates you esthetically. I doubt that toilet sitting sound out of shipping box that pretends to produce music will fascinate you!\n\nOnce again, Spanish guitar improves with an age but not one with the laminated top. If you in budget, do not trash you money with cheap Chinese garbage but save more instead and by the real thing.\n\nHere we are, these are my recommendations for those who really seek to learn to play classical/Spanish guitar:\n\n1. Do not buy guitar online, buy it in the local Guitar Center for example! Listen to the actual instrument. If you like the sound take it!\n\n2. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, they are guitar only by appearance.\n\n3. Buy Spanish guitar from Spanish manufacturer, they start as low as $250, roughly."

That means you will have to be \"gentle\" with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.\n\nSecond, the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.\n\nSo just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others.

But that's not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time, and except for the 58's acoustic foam lined cage pop screen, the two mics are identical electrically.\n\nThe SM (Studio Microphone) 57 was designed to begin it's life in a recording studio, as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers, drum kits, etc. In that capacity, it had no use for the pop screen of it's cousin the SM58, still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day. So the SM57 slimmed down and even though it's still a fine vocal mic, you'll see it used mostly mic'ing instruments, which it excels at.\n\nOne of it's long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the White House. A pair of SM57's is always seen on various White House podiums for press conferences and there is even a VIP bundled kit&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Shure-SM57-VIP-Dual-Microphone-Kit/dp/B000CZ0R3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shure SM57 VIP Dual Microphone Kit</a>&nbsp;you can buy for this exact type of use.\n\nThe SM57 is an extremely rugged mic, built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse. That's one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies. And on top of that, it's just a great sounding mic for the price.\n\nThere is a Performer Series&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Shure-Beta-57A-Microphone/dp/B0002BACAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shure Beta 57A Microphone</a>&nbsp;that looks very similar to the SM57 but the Beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different. So make sure you try before you buy.\n\nBottom line is the Shure SM57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced. A best value for sound companies, home studio recordists and touring musicians."

The Mic appears to be a well designed mic that will go forever (the battery life is great [1AA] too) Great, as well,  its picking up the most sensitive sounds. I also used it with my outdoor drum circle. Listening to the recording, you could close your eyes and you wouldn't know you weren't there in person --- of course the Tascam is pretty high quality, but this is GREAT. Buy it!!!\n\nEDIT - November 16 2016 ---- and this thing is STILL making recordings of live rehearsals that are mind-blowing. I put them on Soundcloud and everyone remarks on how amazing they sound.

The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals, but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned, and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably, then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon, but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics, you can't go wrong here."

In my experience so far it is easier to extract good sound from drums with individual mics rather than trying to capture multiple items with a single mic.  On the other hand, I see (hear) no need to have individual mics for hi-hat and other cymbals when I use two PG81 condenser mics overhead.  The supplied cable with PG56-XLR is only 15 ft long, which even in my small setup is too short (need 25 ft), so opted for the -LC version.  These mics sound awesome, very warm and clean. The PG56s are super directional and pickup almost nothing from other drums when mounted on the supplied A50D rim mounts and pointed towards the drum head. Note that the current amazon description for PG56-LC omits the fact that an A50D rim mount is included in each PG56-LC package (I have submitted a modification request for the description that corrects this omission).  These rim mounts are just perfect for the PG56s, just mount and forget. I run all the mics into a Behringer XENYX 2442 mixer with USB interface, which I run into Studio Mini XL app on my iPad via iPad camera kit USB adapter. Still experimenting with all this but so far I have been very happy with the results."

Pretty rugged and reliable, and the cable isn't bad.\n\nNOTE: if you plan to plug this mic into a 1/4\" input make sure you get a transformer and not just an adapter.

I'm not sure what to say about the sound quality since my stuff isn't state of the art to begin with, but these do what they're supposed to, at a low price! If you're low on cash but need to get some pedals hooked, buy these, then upgrade cables when you have the money if you're unhappy with the quality of these. 4 stars because I like them. Don't love them. Wish the corners were sharper to allow for closer spacing but whatever. Just get those pedals hooked."

Anyway, I've put it through the H E double hockey sticks of a few bands, thrown it around stages, spilled beer in it, even left it in the rain... Still works! It never really sounded all that good to begin with (a bit less clear, more muffled than a SM 58) but it's always had a place in my gear box as a backup. I've used it on vocals and acoustic guitar, banjo and a cabinet or two, and it worked fine for all those things. Not amazing, but ok.\n\nIf you're looking for a good, cheap SM 58 style mic, I'd go with the Behringer 5800. Great mic, sounds really good, costs like twenty bucks. Still not as good as a Shure SM, but you can get four or five for the same price, and I've used those for years as well with pretty good luck, especially on vocals. Even recorded a whole album with them. I wouldn't do it again, but for live vocals in most rooms no one is ever going to know the difference."

I have miked everything from drums, guitars, vocals to woodblocks and even drills/power tools. These mics are fantastic for a closed mic sound as they reject a lot of background noise (so they also work great for playing live). This means they are absolutely fantastic for drums - it's very easy to record multiple tracks with minimal \"bleeding\" coming through on other tracks. I mic all of my drums with these, except I use a Beta 52 for my bass drum, and currently I use lower-end overheads (these are the weak link in my setup). The SM57s aren't fantastic for cymbals.\n\nI love how these mics give me a good clean base recording. Using my favorite DAW (Reaper) I can easily liven the sound up with my own reverbs and such. The SM57s will give you a great image; you just apply your own colors.\n\nI absolutely love hooking these up to my PA and playing live - since they reject much of the background noise, I can crank my PA up loud and it sounds very clear. Also, these are fairly good at rejecting feedback. When I mic my Marshall amp the guitar comes through incredibly loud and clear. You can certainly find a better mic for vocals (these are a little flat-ish and your singer really needs to belt it to get the most out of these), but for general purpose these work great.\n\nHere are the various instruments I have miked, and my opinion on how well these work\nDrums, Toms (great!)\nDrums, Snare (very good)\nDrums, Cymbals (below par)\nDrums, Kick (not bad)\nGuitar, Electric (great!)\nGuitar, Acoustic (good)\nBass Guitar (okay)\nCajon (good)\nBongos (very good)\nVarious Hand Drums (good)\nWood Block (very good)\nIndustrial Sounds, for example: power tools (very good)\nVocals (good)\n\nThese mics are a great choice for many applications. They don't shine in every scenario of course, but generally speaking you can't go wrong. Also, these are built like a tank, and if something does go wrong (busted grill for instance), the replacement parts are easy to find.\n\nThese mics are the staple in my home studio. If you're on a budget and you want something reliable then you certainly can't go wrong with these!"

        "reviewText": "Here's my two-cents...\n\nSynth Engine\nFor starters, the 4 voice synth engine is solid and has the ability to create some amazing sounds that span the entire audio spectrum from gut churning basses to angelic and ethereal pads. That said, the 128 presets that it ships with are pretty decent to get you started, but PLEASE refrain from using them in your recordings/performances without doing a decent amount of tweaking and effecting. The mK seems to have a very unique sonic footprint, and since so many people own this synth, using the presets as-is is definitely going to be frowned upon. Of course this can be said about any synth, but especially for the microKORG. There's nothing quite as anticlimactic as seeing a band perform live using the mK and you recognize they're using factory preset A43. True story. The built-in delay/ensemble effects are great, but I think the mK sounds 1000x better when ran through some outboard effects. If I want a sick and meaty low-end bass that easily lends itself to (gag) dubstep or drum & bass, I'll run the mono output of the Korg to an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Electro-Harmonix-Bass-Big-Muff-Distortion-Pedal/dp/B001C1A6CI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Electro-Harmonix Bass Big Muff Distortion Pedal</a>&nbsp;and then directly to the board or to a bass amp. It's pretty filthy.\n\nEditing\nEditing and tweaking your own patches is easy enough via the seven knobs and 3 character LED screen, but it tends to be a time-consuming process, especially since there's no visual feedback of your tweaks. If membrane style programming isn't your bag, then you should definitely download the free microKORG Patch Editor, however since the mK lacks USB connectivity, I suggest the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/M-Audio-USB-Midisport-Uno-MIDI-Interface/dp/B00007JRBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">M-Audio USB Midisport Uno MIDI Interface</a>. Both the MIDI implementation and the editor are a tad wonky, but you will be able to visually access and edit all of the synth's parameters. Adding to the USB/MIDI functionality, once you've made your connection, you can also sequence the mK from your workstation (Ableton, FL Studio, Sonar, etc.) via MIDI out. This of course, opens up a whole new world of possibilities and will really let you unleash the power of the microKORG. Finally, since the synth engine is same one used in the Korg MS-2000, you can import MS-2000 patches into the mK by means of sysex files. You'll need a MIDI utility such as MIDI OX, and from there, it's gets a little complicated, but if you're a true synth-geek and you want your microKORG to sound like an MS-2000, it might be worth it.\n\nVocoder\nTruth be told, this was a key factor in my decision to purchase the mK as I wanted it for live vocoding. Software/VST vocoders are great, but they tend to be process hogs, especially in live situations, so for this reason alone, I insisted on the hardware route. Upon setup, the first thing you need to do is replace the freebie gooseneck microphone that it ships with. A lot of the reviews that I've read say that the mK's vocoder sucks, which if you use the gooseneck, I somewhat agree with, however after popping in an inexpensive dynamic mic, the quality difference is absolutely amazing. Also, depending on your intentions, the supplied vocoder patches are pretty lame, so you will definitely want to create your own, either manually or with the software editor, especially if you're going for the traditional robot/Cylon effect. On a final, yet critical note, since the mK only boasts an 8 band vocoder, I strongly suggest running the output through an EQ to enhance the mids and highs.\n\nBuild/Layout\nUnless you're one of those types who regularly abuses your equipment, the mK is built solid enough for stage use, but then again, I'm also the type that tends to baby my gear. Right out of the box, the faux wood side-panels felt a tad loose, which made it feel a little flimsy, but after a few turns with the screwdriver, they were nice and tight and it definitely felt more solid. I've also noticed that a lot of people seem to complain about the keys, either their size or feel. I do admit that they do take a little getting used to, but unless you're recreating Flight of the Bumblebee, you should be able to manage just fine, even with stubby little sausage fingers. Naturally, if worse comes to worse, you can always connect a full size MIDI controller and use the mK as a stand-alone sound module. As far as running via battery power, the concept is pretty cool, but be warned, they do drain pretty quickly and will give you a little over an hour of playing and tweaking. I've never been the type to rely on battery power, especially for outboard gear or effect pedals, so I would suggest sticking with the wall-wart. Lastly, don't be fooled by the bank names on the Program Select panel because they really don't do any justice for the mK. I'm sure \"Trance\", \"Techno/House\", \"Electronica\", etc. were used for marketing purposes by satisfying the instant gratification factor for that out-of-box experience.\n\nIn Summation\nIf you have one, keep it 'n tweak it, and if you're on the fence about getting one; get it! I know there are literally thousands of VSTi plugins that that have more bells and whistles in one oscillator than the mK has in total, but for the price, you get a lot of bang for your buck, plus a cool piece of hardware. I'm not saying that it's an all-in-one or everyday synth, but it's definitely a cool piece of kit to have in your arsenal. Lastly, if you're looking for an easy talkbox solution (a la Roger Troutman), I suggest pairing your microKORG with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rocktron-Banshee-2/dp/B0014Z37H8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rocktron Banshee 2</a>."

Hooked it up and gave it a whirl and was very, very surprised at how good it sounds. It is right there on top. Better than the Signet it replaces and even better than the Stanton 881S. The latter of which has aged some 40 years so that may not be a fair comparison. The Stanton was state of the art for it's day and still sounds decent but figured, I don't spin the vinyl a lot so a decent cartridge would be more than adequate. Audio Technica has always made decent products. Their Mics and other equipment is reliable as it gets. You won't spend a lot of money but you will get a good product. Now, this cartridge is a bargain but sounds as good as some of the top selling ones selling for many times  the price. That's a huge bonus. With Amazon's great return policy, I figured it was worth a try and if it sounded awful, I could return it. Won't need to do that. It's a great find. I would not hesitate to get it again.\n\nPros: Great sound, all the hardware for both mounts are included. Highs and lows are well defined but not overpowering. Just clean. Mids are crystal clear. That is what we used to dream about in the old days. I couldn't see spending the money on a better one when these do so well and they do not require a lot of tracking force. That, alone, is a real bonus.\n\nCons: None.\nBottom line: Great cartridge. Very reasonable price."

It also slides easy through the mess of other wires, pedals, and amps that it gets tangled in. I really like the classic look though it is a very modern shielded cable. It is as quiet or quieter than any other cable I own, and at the price, this is a very good deal. My practice room has 12- 4' x 4 bulb fluorescent light fixtures- yes, that is 48 light total. They are the old kind with noisy ballasts. This cable just doesn't let that stuff in, though. Very good shielding for $16 at18 feet.\n\nOn the other hand, I am not used to using 24 gauge conductors and probably wouldn't if this cable was longer than 18 ft. That would probably be my only knock and it isn't really a knock since it is appropriately sized for the length.\n\nThis is a pro cable (gauge question aside) at consumer pricing. The plugs can be opened and checked or re-soldered if you ever have an accident or need. But, from my short use over the last month, I don't think I'll ever need to open this cable. Buying two more today.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 5 Stars"

I do notice that unless I have a very clean pressing, there are more ticks from surface noise than with other cartridges. When I record an LP for home network streaming, I sometimes switch to my Denon DL-110, since it is less likely to make surface noise apparent. For overall detail, though, the AT 440MLa is hard to beat and the pricing through an Amazon reseller was the best I found anywhere. AT cartridges are also not fussy about cable capacitance (\"loading\"), unlike some cartridges such as the better Shures and a few others. If your tonearm can handle a high compliance cartridge, I highly recommend this. You can get replacement styli, too, unlike some of the more esoteric moving-coil designs which are very pricey. Having heard supposedly \"better\" moving-coil designs, I prefer the AT. I track it at 1.4G and the microline stylus is superb, especially on inner-groove tracking. Very revealing, though, so you will want to have a good regimen for cleaning your records!"

Have a thin sounding amp ? Try this one.\nTons of bass with the deep control and plenty of mids.\nDecent noise performance.\nCan do overdrive and high gain overdrive (don't expect super high gain but there's plenty of gain for 80's rock tones)\nGreat for smaller gigs, you can leave your big racks and amps at home.\nGet that cranked Marshall sound without the deafening volumes.\nWell built.\n\nCons :\n\nPerhaps too much low end for bigger amps (the good thing is you can dial it out and still get a great sound)\nIt's a bit dark sounding (but you can modify it)\nKnobs are hard to read in a typical live situation.\n\nSo is it the best OD / Distortion pedal ? No, there are others that sound better but not by a mile, for the price I think this is a great score.\nThere you have it."

As a primarily electric player, I find myself reaching for this guitar much more often than I reach for my much more expensive Seagull entourage rustic steel string acoustic. I have played much more expensive classical guitars, and, though they may feel slightly better, they sound about the same, and offer the same range of tonal possibilities (maybe a true classical guitarist might beg to differ, but for the occasional gipsy kings play along, latin jazz/bossa nova, and Bouree in E minor, it is quite acceptable). It comes rather decently set up out of the box, as I've never had to change a thing, it takes abuse rather well, sounds and looks pretty good, and definitely won't break the bank. It's definitely a guitar that you won't be afraid to take places, and will never regret bringing along if you do. For the beginning guitarist, someone starting out in classical, flamenco, or fingerstyle, or anyone who's looking for a very playable inexpensive instrument to add to their collection, this instrument really fits the bill."

The downside to using this (or any lapel mike) was it doesn't do as well as picking up surrounding conversations - such as questions during a face to face conference room training.  In that case, I simply had to remind the key speaker to repeat the question and then answer it.  There were some big advantages over the 20' wired lapel mike I used - mostly the absence of the cable.  There there was little difference in audio quality.  I also did a brief test recording audio in separate rooms, with a closed door - and while my test was far from complete, the audio was still good.  I think some of the concerns are the claims that this can work from 300 feet.  I can't say that it does or doesn't.  The 9V batteries lasted a good 8 hours each.  It was unclear to me (probably because I didn't real all the directions) if there was a warning to change the batteries or not (I'll have to go back and check) but, for my basic needs, this worked fine and the audio quality was good.  Never had to change channels."

It probably has the ability to handle a higher sound pressure level also, but most won't care about that.\n\nThe pickup pattern is so tight that you will usually want to be within an inch of the windscreen, but this is why you won't get feedback as easily from it. Well, you know how you have to work the mic to adjust for louder and softer, now you'll just be working it at a closer distance, just remember to roll off the lows to reduce the proximity effect. But this is probably just it's biggest benefit of many, although it also makes it a bad choice for using one mic in front of three singers.\n\nThis microphone speaks of quality and durability in your hand, it's solid and heavy. The handling noise is excellent for those of you using this as a hand held microphone, it's quiet. It's frequency response drops down to 40Hz, making it an excellent choice for an instrument mic also. This will do a good job on close up work with guitar cabs to brass, providing excellent rejection of other sounds, The bottom of a snare or anyplace that you want a high rejection ratio, and can also fit this size of microphone.\n\nSo for those of you looking for it double as a recording microphone, because where you are recording has a high noise floor, it will work out well also. Being a studio owner, I suggest the quietest possible place to record and a low noise floor, but I know that it's not always possible. It will do a great job of rejecting other sound and focusing on what it's in front of.\n\nYou'll get a good clip and an average carry bag with it.\n\nIt's a good, high quality microphone at a fairly low price, and I can recommend it."

After about a week the grain had deepened substantially. Then sanding, and a little more of a suntan.  Make up the neck joint, using rubber bands for camping.  I used hide glue, but didn't care for the joint, so steamed it apart and used good wood glue.  That made a much better joint.  More sanding, and masking for the saddle.  Glued on the fingerboard using rubber bands and pencils as clamps.\nONe problem I had was getting the fattest string to stay in the saddle.  I'm going to have to widen the slot in the saddle to get the string to stay in.  It'll stay in for awhile, but when you're playing, it sometimes pops out.\nI would buy this kit again in a second, and I may very well buy another one.\n\nVideo of unboxing and assembly at http://youtu.be/4K9LxHAjlkE"

Once we removed the switch (the weakest link), we had no issues.\n\nIf you need something reliable for a peformance I would recommend something like the Proco Power Mute.  Sure it's more expensive, but it's built like a tank, the performer can stomp on the footswitch and the light turns green (mic on) or red (mic off), and it's transparent as far as effecting your sound.  Also no worries about extending the mic or cable run with this long switch."

Very easy to bend or break a needle when putting it on because you are putting it straight towards the exposed needle and it you even bump it, your needle will get bent.

My brother and I play together regularly and I like to record what we play. I was previously using a generic vocal mic to record with but there was always an annoying crunchy tone and blandness I couldn't get over. I would always have to tweak the amp or the actual recording to get a decent sound and remove some of the unwanted tone.  When the Shure SM57 arrived I set it up and adjusted my amp back to how I like it. After the first recording I was thrilled. The recording actually sounded like the sound coming from the amp. The mic only picks up the perfect tones while leaving the garbage behind. After moving the mic around a bit I actually have a near professional quality. The sound is crisp, clear, and I know what I'm recording as I'm playing. This mic beats out anything in the price range. Don't spend more for less."

Good acoustic guitar sound with that electric aliveness & sustain. Both mics input to m-audio audiobuddy with separate vol pots to mix feed into home stereo system. Strong, clear low B & bass notes. Lotsa fun on michael hedges pieces. Great if amping needs are moderate. No hum but feedback & hiss if u push it. Good and cheap for the home player. Sounds clearer than newer version."

If you're mainly doing techno and house stuff, you might as well go with the much cheaper Sennheiser HD505, not for sale anymore.\nThey have the Sennheiser 202 which are very close to the 505's. SOundwise they sound about just as good, little less mids, just as loud (if not louder), just as good lowend, crisper brights. I find the senheisers better sounding than these sony's, although these sony's sound more linear, less crisp, more evened out in sound.\n\nthese sony's are better for overall listening, like a variety of styles ranging from classic,to jazz, to pop etc... The Senheisers are better for techno, house, pop, dance, r&b, hiphop etc...\n\nIf I can compare these 2 headphones (as they're all I have to compare eachother with),\nI'd go for the senheisers, because they're less than a quarter the price of these sony's and overall just as good.\nIf you're an audiophile, wanting to get the best, obviously these sony's are better, but not by much.

I read a lot of reviews and did my research and it seemed like this amp would be the best for me. I'm living in a college apartment so I didn't want to go too big and annoy my neighbors. I also didn't have much of a budget for a guitar amp, so I decided to buy low. The package came in a couple of days later and I opened it up and was amazed at the size of this thing! The picture makes it look like an eraser but it's the size of a man's shoebox. The clean channel sounds unbelievably clean. I couldn't help but compare it to my old Ibanez IBZ-10 Tone Blaster Amp which sounded like there was a perpetual colony of bees hiving inside the speaker. The volume gets pretty loud even for its size and it still maintains that clean sound even at 12 gain and 12 volume. The \"overdrive\" setting is cool too. I haven't tinkered with that one too much, but it's fun to play \"Johnny B. Goode\" on.\n\nI didn't want to buy an amp that had all of the shiny bells and whistles that fall off after the first month. I wanted a quality amp for a low price, and I got it. You can always buy pedals to get all those cool sounds, and I plan on doing that too, but you need a good amp with a good clean channel like this one before you start getting into other effects. I would definitely recommend this amp to the college apartment dweller and to anyone else who wants an amazing practice amp.\n\nI'm not sure if this would be the best gigging amp though, but then again, I don't see myself gigging anytime soon."

And if someone questions you on them, lie and say they're a knock of version of Beats by Dre without the fancy logo and hardware, but the internal stuff is the same.

I just recently replaced one that I had been heavily using since the mid-1980s ... so they last. The pedal feels good under your foot and it is smooth. If you use more than one, they can be conveniently attached together. The FC7 is one of those rare musical products that hasn't been cheapened over time.

        "reviewText": "This is a great package for beginners. I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago.  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called \"Easy Ukelele\" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free.  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. I purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it. I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.\n\nMy Review:\n\n1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the \"Easy Ukelele\" app I mentioned above.\n\n2. The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent. It has a sticker that says made in china. It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune. It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle. I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string.  It could be that the string included is a cheap one.  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine).  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning. I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range. I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it.\n\nSo, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.\n\n2. The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string. The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string. The extra string package says \"Gangia Brand\" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.\n\n3. The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners. The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.\n\n4. The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.\n\n5. The DVD's and CD's: I have not tried the DVD and CD's yet but the DVD's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.\n\nOverall. This is a great price for the package."

I suspect it is called \"Phantom\" power, because there is no indication that it is there, except that a condenser microphone won't work without it.  Sometimes, a condenser microphone will have its own power source, usually a battery, to provide the electrical power for the microphone circuitry.\n\nWhen considering microphone choices, two rules come to mind.\n\n\"Dynamic\" microphones, do not, and cannot use \"phantom\" power.  If you connect a dynamic microphone to a microphone port that provides phantom power, you will have a broken dynamic microphone.  Sometimes there is a switch to turn off any phantom power.\n\n\"Condenser\" microphones, on the other hand, DO REQUIRE phantom power and usually cost more than dynamic microphones, because they have internal electronics that require a power source, i.e. Phantom Power.\n\nEven though it does not mention the microphone type, based on the price alone, I can tell you that this is probably a dynamic type microphone and if it sounds terrible at 8 bucks, then it probably sounds like a cheap microphone."

When compared to a stock Shure 92E, this Audio Technica 92ECD stands head and shoulders above the stock Shure in terms of high frequency response-cymbals etc. I'm sure the narrower elliptical stylus helps. However, a Shure M92e with an upgraded stylus gives this AT a good run for the money. No, the AT's not as \"neutral\" sounding as the Shure, but, to my ear anyway is also quite balanced. This is a good basic upgrade cartridge. It's not an \"audiophile\" contender but reproduces music nicely, well beyond most basic cartridges. Good \"universal\" value especially in that it can be used as either a P mount or standard. Have a listen, you can't go wrong for the price."

However, upper frequencies-cymbals, \"s's\" etc.-can sometimes get muddy depending on the recording. Don't let this scare you. This cart will track almost anything! If you can find a Shure 104E stylus to replace the stock stylus you'll be pleasantly surprised at how good the 92E cartridge really sounds! I only give it 4 stars because the stock stylus is a little lacking on the high end, at least to my ear anyway! Good overall value especially given that it's a \"universal\" mounting  system.\n\n10+Year Follow up (10-18-15)-Dusted off a back up Technics p-mount table while my main one's being serviced. Installed a new belt and picked up 2 new carts (a Shure M92E and an Audio Technica AT 92E)  for a comparison while the Big Dog's away. Played each with their stock stylus for about 10 hours before listening. Tough call as to which one sounds better to my ear. The AT definately has more upper frequency detail BUT the Shure sounds more \"full, balanced and warmer.\" In my opinion, the Shure produces more of that \"classic vinyl sound\" than the AT. Choose whichever \"flavor\" suits you best. You won't go wrong either way. A good preamp helps. BTW, each cart's stock stylus can be easily upgraded. FYI, replaced the stock Shure .4 X .7 elliptical stylus with a JICO .3 X .7 elliptical, 776 DEX. Still sounds warm and full but with much more detail and \"authority.\"\n\n12-5-15 Update. Upgraded the stylus on my Shure M97 XE with an after market hyper elliptical - great improvement!  Took the newly \"spare\"  M97 XE stylus and installed it on the M92E running on a p-mount table. It weighed about 1.25 grams more than the p-mount tracking standard of 1.25 grams. Didn't want to increase the tonearm mass by adding weight behind the pivot point. So, I carefully removed the 97XE's stabilizer brush assembly from the stylus assembly with a utility knife then reinstalled it. However, it now weighed in a bit under 1.25 grams. Added a small blob of Blu Tack on the top of the cart to correct the tracking force weight, molded it to conform then painted it black. What a sonic improvement! Best sounding \"M92E\" yet!! GEEK OUT!"

Not a constant static, but enough to keep me close (FYI I have lots of phone lines and power lines going over my yard which may have caused the static).\n\nFor my uses, spending an additional $300 for a UHF unit isn't worth it. As a comparison, I own a very nice AT4033 studio microphone and this sounds just about as good going into a Canon 60D with Magic Lantern firmware (which took care of the bad hiss problem). The ability to monitor the sound via the included earbud is a very nice bonus. It's lightweight and easy to carry around and doesn't seem to eat up my rechargable 9v batteries.\n\nI'm thrilled a company with a great reputation offers an affordable, high-quality wireless mic. Great job AT! Now you just need to follow it up with an affordable UHF version. I really don't understand the drastic price differences..I guess I need an MBA for that...."

        "reviewText": "Below applies to the AT311EP; for some crazy reason Amazon bundles a dozen or more cartridges together which are in some cases nothing alike, yet the reviews all flow as if they were one.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nYou cannot beat the value of this cartridge.\n\nFor one, the cost of the stylus itself is a few hairs shy of the cost Amazon offers the whole enchilada for.  Second, the performance of AT's is second-to-none for the P-mount form-factor.  Those of us, myself included, with a turntable taking this format find ourselves with dwindling options.  When I decided to replace the cartridge I bought my used Denon DP-7F with, I was nervous as I liked the sound the ADC (no model anywhere!) was putting out.  I ordered an AT3482 initially, which it turns out is an entry model void of any depth and life.  Harsh and cold, I disappointingly put the original back (aware with an unknown number of hours on the clock it could be wearing my vinyl faster), and I got Amazon to kindly take the 3482 back and sell me a 311EP.\n\nImmediately apparent was the increased clarity, depth, spatial separation, and eventually came the greater warmth.  It was sufficient off the bat, but I found (and have read others have had the same experience) that some time in, it gets the groove (pun intended) and shows its true colors.  I can say this was the case for me, and as long as you keep it clean with a stylus cleaner you will have a very pleasant experience.\n\nI can also say that a friend's house with Magnepan speakers off a vintage Carver amp and a Technics turntable with a very similar model cartridge gave depth and spatialization out of this world for this price point on Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here.\n\nThe instructions when you open the packaging tell you (out of an abundance of caution I hope) to remove the stylus from the cartridge when installing, then reinsert.  This looks easy on paper, but I couldn't get it to separate, and I was applying more than sufficient force to my thinking.  I can see why, you could bump into the needle with one of your fingers while pushing into the tonearm and then game over, but you just hold it by the sides, slide it in, then screw it down, and less than a minute later all is well.  You can't really make adjustments on the P-mount system, so you will get it right and without delay.\n-------------------------------------------------------Below applies to the AT100E----------------------------------------\nJust installed a month ago in a 1979 Dual 1264.  The Pickering XV15 from some time ago had the vintage look, and after I'd restored the Dual I tried to keep that look intact, starting with a new stylus to replace the original D400.  Turned out the tunnel the stylus went into was worn, and the assembly itself would come loose with playing and that of course is dangerous and resulted in poor sound.  Another $90 in to a labor of love, and enter the AT100E, which looks good and sounds good.\n\nRight off the bat, one difference between it and the EV stylus I tried to replace the D400 with (and even the AT311EP's I love) was that out of the box the sound was natural.  The EV stylus had lots of surface noise for a few hours, then dramatically settled down (I also cleaned it once but that didn't seem to do much), the AT311EP's settle down nicely after about 5-10 hours.  I've got about 20 hours on the clock with this one and it hasn't changed, which is impressive to me; maybe this will change in months' time.\n\nI am running the tracking force (at the recommendation of the shop that restored the Dual) close to the upper limit of 1.8 (I'm at 1.75, while the manual states optimal is 1.4).  The anti-staking is just shy of 2, and every so often it seems the right channel has some distortion which may mean I need to make a skating adjustment, but I have no blank vinyl to test it on (yet).\n\nThe needle doesn't ride quite as low as the AT311EP, which appears dangerously close to the vinyl, but never touches, even with a warp.  I miss the dust cap on the old cartridge/stylus, but am glad to stick with AT.  Much of my vinyl isn't new, esoteric 180g limited edition purchases, more of the good and great shape used copies from the Bay Area and Sacramento (a haven for collectors), so getting into the diminishing return rare air of uber equipment is not my gig.\n\nThe bass could use some extra umph, but what is there is warm and not overwhelming.  Highs are very natural and never harsh.  Jazz such as Miles Davis' Kind of Blue and Maynard really show the brass instruments and percussion.  LOTS of stereo separation, impressive staging if you sit in the sweet spot of your speakers."

My reason for dinging them a star, is that I've Seen the Planet Waves adapters, and Hosa's stuff is just not really as polished and nice.  These stick in some XLR males (in direct boxes, for example), and really have to be pulled/wiggled out with effort.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but the release buttons are really tiny and pointy, and you have to press them crazy hard to pull them out of any panel mount connector.  Plus the finish leaves a bit to be desired, although over all that doesn't matter much.  In short: if you need them, their fine.  They could just be more classy in their physical design."

For the extra 15 bucks, the Sony MS907 is easily worth the upgrade.  The only advantage of the DS70 is not having to worry about having a fresh battery installed.  The MS907 sounds fuller and richer, but frankly I did not judge it to be superior to the overall effect of the 4-point microphone that comes with the popular Zoom H-2.  Whether or not you choose to use it in place of the onboard mic of a high-end personal audio recorder really comes down to a matter of personal taste.  On the other hand, if you've picked up the new Zoom H-4n, this Sony stereo mic would be an excellent choice for complementing the onboard ones since the new Zoom allows for use of onboard and external mics simultaneously.\n\nAs for recording to a software audio program on an iMac, that particular computer has an audio input that will accommodate the 3.5mm plug (but be aware that many computers do not have such an input--in that case, look at a USB mic such as those from Blue).  Even with the right fit and a fresh battery, I found the MS907 to be somewhat underpowered for optimal results.  It wasn't until I plugged it into an Onkyo preamp that I was satisfied.  Again, I suspect that a mic with a USB connector would permit better gain levels with most computers.\n\nThere are adequate mic amps on Amazon for $20-$40, capable of boosting your signal by 48 volts, or 60 dbs. A Mac user willing to spend a bit more should look at the MXL Signal Booster Amp for Mac Computers, which costs a bit more but saves you the bother of USB conversion. Finally, if you're trying to make professional announcements for radio use, etc., you'll soon discover that, unless you're incapable of puckering (which means you're not much of a kisser), the plosives (\"p\" sounds) will run away with everything you try to say. The only solutions I've found are to write scripts that are devoid of plosives (the \"voiced\" \"b\" phoneme is almost as much of an offender as the voiceless \"p\" phoneme) or to pick up a \"pop filter.\" The latter are little more than 6\" circles of cheese cloth costing $20-$30 each, but I'm about to give in and order one from Amazon.\n\nThe last advice I'll offer is not to indulge in candy or a sweet soda while broadcasting. It'll thicken your saliva and make you sound like someone attempting to communicate with his dentist after being shot up with novocaine (or is it lidocaine, these days?)--in any case, it's sugar cane, and fuctose syrup, that will muck up your elocution, making your gums talk louder than your words."

Ignore the cord and simply attach the mic directly to the machine for a package that is scarcely any larger, heavier or less convenient than the original machine.  Surprisingly, Panasonic offers no mic for the recorder, even though it's seen at least two editions.  With the cassette machine I notice no improvement in sound quality with the higher-priced, stick-shaped Sony stereo mic.\n\nHaving had a couple of misfires with a digital mini-recorder (admittedly not \"mechanical\" breakdowns), I'd still recommend a cassette machine, if only for a back-up."

These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet.  It's all about money to them.  I couldn't believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics (even lower-priced several years ago) and insisting they were as good as Shure SM-57's and 58's.  I still don't believe the quality of workmanship compares (any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much).  But these Nady's handle the announcing, the vocals, and, when needed, the softer sounding instruments (flute, harmonica), and none has broken or quit on my watch.\n\nI'm a keyboardist, so mic power and fidelity don't affect me.  I'm only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important \"gear component.\"  At the same time, my embarrassment, I confess, is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee.  After all, who's playing--and getting paid for it?"

        "reviewText": "I started with the Shure PG58 and most recently acquired the Shure SM58.  I'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 G's simply isn't that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks.  But with respect to the Shure, I'm less sure that the SM58 isn't worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and \"clean\" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).\n\nP.S. I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58.  Since the rise of the \"digital audio workstation\" (who doesn't have a computer with free, included Garage Band on it?), large, even gold-plated, expensive-looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place.  Despite appearances, when it comes to mics, size doesn't matter--except for appearances (directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half-way around the face, knowing that the girls in the front-line think they're cool--they look just like Madonna'a or Janet's headgear). Some of the best mics are tiny, with an opening the size of a pin-hole."

I'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P.A.). Whatever the reason, the PG-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1/4\" adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic).  When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it's the most popular microphone in the world.  For five bucks extra, I can't fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch.  It's a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of \"private\" comments by indiscreet band members.  And even if you're an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57.  The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.\n\n[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of \"this seller.\"  Perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns.  But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place.  They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility.  In fact, it's the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators.  Consumers require choice, but with the Shure SM58 there need be none.]"

We proposed plopping down nearly 4 C-notes on a dozen 20-foot Standard 100 mike cables to our church's finance council.  The words \"Lifetime Warranty\" were the clincher.\n\nHum? Forget about it. Cell phone static? Thing o' the past. CB radio interference? Tunes it right out. The secret is twisted pair construction, which eats up an extra inch or so of wire per foot of finished cable. The signal becomes its own electronic shield against noise. Cheaper cables use a side-by-side or linear configuration.  It saves wire and keeps the price down but the cable acts as an antenna and attracts all kinds of electromagnetic junk from the air.\n\nThe jacket resists twisting and uncoils smoothly. It also rolls up for storage without fighting back like a snake that's had a few espresso shots.\n\nThe ends are finished with somewhat oversize connectors, providing a generous grip for smooth insertion and removal, but they can be a hindrance for performers who like a grab a mike off the stand and solo. That's not a problem in a church choir, so we expect the cables to last a long time. If you need a cable with a slimmer connector, move up to the Performer 500 or Studio Pro 1000 series.\n\nThe finishing touch in our sound setup is the Monster Cable S-100 instrument patch cord and an attenuating adapter for hooking our mixer to the sound system. Velvety-quiet signal transfer and audio quality that's good to the last note.\n\nWe have yet to use the Lifetime Warranty but the peace of mind is, well, as good as a gift from God."

It's my first VOX.  I cascade OD and this OD functions just on the edge of dysfunction, and it's totally addictive.  I plug it thru a 4X12 which really loses the SS tone.  It just oozes MAD tone.  Obviously I had to strip a guitar cord to plug into large 8 Ohm speakers.  I own 3 other tube Amps (Ampeg, Fuchs and Blackheart) and 2 or 3 (2 Marshall, Roland) solid states.  This amp fills a very nice void other Amps can't provide.  It's user friendly, does what it's supposed to do.  I read a review where the reviewer said it's the best thing VOX has done in 40 years."

It's really a problem with all Hosa XLR products in that the XLR connectors they use on everything are really cheap and have a poor design flaw where the cable moves too freely in the rubber boot without any real crimping of the cable by the plug. As a result, the wire will eventually break strand by strand at the pins of the connector as the cable works its way back and forth from use. Higher quality and higher price XLR connectors like the industry standard Neutrik XLR plugs have a different design and don't allow this to happen. Then again, you won't find a Neutrik Y adapter for the low price of these Hosa ones. They are cheap and they work for awhile but for as cheap as they are you can just buy new ones when the old ones develop a short which is exactly what I did."

For the price, this mic compares very favorably.\n- Versatility.  Handles high sound pressure (SPL) with grace, which means you can mic your loud guitar cabinet.  Also does well at lower volumes with your preamp gain cranked up.  If you need more sensitivity, go with a condenser mic.\n- Solid construction.  Built like a more expensive mic.  Takes a beating and still sounds great.\n- Price.  Just fantastic value.\n- Response curve.  Fairly flat with 10 db drop-off from 200 to 50 hz.  Can be used to mic almost anything with a bit of eq tweaking.\n\nOther thoughts:\n- I also like the even-more-affordable PG48, especially for a cheap bass guitar cabinet mic.  It's frequency response drops off a little later (losing 10db from 100hz to 50hz instead of starting higher at 200hz).\n\nOverall, for the price, I believe you can get amazing effects with this PG mic and a decent preamp."

The thing is rock solid. Durability will be a non-issue for me.\n\nIf you want a solid gigging mic this is great for the price."

        "reviewText": "This review is for the microKORG XL+, which is not the original microKORG released around 2001 or the updated XL released in 2008.  The microKORG XL+ came out in 2012, and is basically a further expansion on the virtual analog (\"VA\") modeling engine used in the XL, plus some additional PCM samples (for example, there is a traditional piano sound and an M1 organ now available).\n\nBUILD QUALITY - The marketing of the \"XL\" and \"XL+\" is a bit confusing because I am pretty sure that both models are actually lighter, smaller, and have fewer knobs and buttons than the original microKORG (while generally going for the same price or possibly a little more).  The build quality and choice of materials is probably the poorest aspect of the XL+.  Considering that this is a product intended to retail for around $500, and comparing that to what is offered by the new Korg Minilogue and comparably priced (but functionally very different) products from Arturia and Novation, the plastic housing, plastic jacks, and semi-suspect knobs are a bit of a disappointment.  To be honest, if I were any kind of serious musician that needed to play this synth live (or even take it out of my house), I probably couldn't give it a 5-star review.  But I think that it's a device that should work and continue to work for many years in a home studio setting, and with reasonable care and use.\n\nAt the same time, Korg's design choices have other advantages which become more obvious once you own and use the device for awhile.  This thing is LIGHT - weighing in at only a few pounds, it's fully capable of being played on your lap comfortably (I actually played it in my car a bit the other day just because I can).  This thing is also extremely PORTABLE - not many synths with this kind of firepower can run for about 4 hours on 6 AA batteries.  You can power it with Korg's KA350 9V adapter (which, unfortunately, is center-positive and a bit of a non-standard barrel size), but I'm thinking I'm just as likely to throw a set of Eneloop rechargeables in there, and it will encourage me to use it all the often.  So, yes, the XL+ doesn't necessarily \"feel\" like a professional device, but at least on my unit, everything works reliably, and owning this synth begs the question about so many other mini-synths on the market: What, really, is the point of making synths smaller if they are still heavy, clumsy, and anchored to a wall adapter.  The XL+ is none of those things, and is all the better for it.\n\nINTERFACE & PROGRAMMING - The microKORG XL+ has 37 mini keys, and a 3-octave range (with additional octave up and down switch, of course).  Keyboards are very subjective and I find that even if you prefer a firmer or looser action on keys, your opinion may differ depending on the type of playing you are doing.  For example, I find that the firmer approach of something like Arturia MicroBrute is better for percussive monophonic sequences or \"finger drumming\", whereas the microKORG XL+ requires a much lighter touch to press the keys.  While the real estate is a bit tight and the looseness takes a little getting used to, I find it more piano-like and sensitive to subtle velocity differences than many other cheap synth and MIDI controller keyboards I have used.  I actually think I might prefer this as a pure \"keyboard\" over my CME XKey 37, which is full-size but has very non-traditional \"button\" keys.\n\nIt seems impossible that a synth with as few knobs and buttons as the XL+ has could have much depth, but here again Korg made some very intelligent and beginner-friendly design choices.  For example, there are only 3 parameter control knobs, but a 4th knob selects different editing \"banks\", and these are universal to all of your presets/programs.  They are also clearly labeled on the dashboard, so I was able to figure out how to tweak the release time or modify the filter without even checking the manual.  In fact, while there is a LCD screen, the XL+ is careful not to over-rely on it.  You'll only really find yourself scrolling through text options on the screen if you are changing to a different effect, or making deeper parameter edits.\n\nOne thing the XL+ probably could have used was a button selector for quick switching between presets.  I really have no idea how you would use this thing live if you needed to change to a different preset mid-song.  The MiniNova and even some other Korg products use a button bank that is much easier to navigate on the fly.\n\nSOUNDS & VERSATILITY - The XL+ is a very preset-based machine, which is both good and bad.  There are two schools of thought when it comes to beginners and synths.  The first school says that every important function should get its own knob, and that you should just have a wall of choices in front of you as you learn the basics of synthesis and tweak them on a dashboard.  The second school of thought (and one that I am coming around to) is that \"more is not always better\" and that by having too many variables, you can actually frustrate and overwhelm people who just want to grab a device and make music.  The XL+ has MASSIVE power, but much of it is baked into the presets that you swap in and out and create using the computer editor.  On the PC editor, you can do things like access Korg's library of programs based on VA subtractive synthesis or PCM samples.  I'm totally blown away by how varied the sounds are in the XL+.  Combined with 8-note polyphony, it's capable deep sub basses, haunting pads, chiptune leads, and warm vintage analog poly chords.\n\nBut probably my favorite aspect of the XL+ is how useful it is in my workflow.  The on-board sounds are great on their own, but the XL+ is also an outstanding (and very portable) MIDI controller.  It even supplies MIDI power, so I can use it with a sound module like the Ploytec PL2, or even power the Retrokits RK002 Midiator cable designed for the Volca Sample and Volca FM.  It has a headphone jack (1/4\") and two 1/4\" outputs for a mixer, computer interface, or recording device.  There is also an input jack so you can apply external sounds to Korg's excellent filters and effects.\n\nI'm relatively new to hardware synthesizers, but even in my limited experience with other budget/compact gear, the microKORG XL+ really stands out.  The wildly popular Arturia MicroBrute and MiniBrute are great devices, but they're also monosynths and far more limited in scope than the XL+.  I own basically all of the Korg Volca series, and while those are great devices, I feel like the microKORG XL+ covers about 90-95% of the sounds I could conceivably make with the Volca Bass, Keys, and FM combined.  Not to mention that it comes with a 37-key keyboard that you can actually play, that can be powered by battery, and that you can effectively use as a MIDI keyboard with some of your other devices.  The microKORG XL+ isn't the newest or sexiest toy on block, but remains an example of \"digital done right\".  It's capable of playing hundreds of different sounds from some of Korg's best products of the past 20 years, and allowing the user to tweak them even further with a simple layout of knobs on the device.  I think it could be the integral component to a budget home studio, especially combined with a good drum machine and mono synth for bass/lead work."

They will add some noise to your signal that you will only notice in studio use. It's not a huge amount and it can be easily removed but, for most applications, a studio engineer will prefer a clean signal to a convenient one. Still, If I'm working with an artist that can't settle down if he/she doesn't have a switch, I'll do what I have to do to keep the peace and record the piece."

        "reviewText": "Just got back into guitar after a 20 year break, and started gearing up again. This past year, I bought a Kirlin cable, this Hosa cable, a GLS Audio cable, and a Seismic Audio cable.  Of the bunch, the Kirlin is my favorite -- it's clear that the metal connector design and the strain reliefs are designed for heavy duty usage. The cable thickness is also the largest diameter of the 4 I bought, and the weave of the braid is tight. Overall, if I had to guess which cable was going to last the longest, I'd guess the Kirlin one. It will last forever used just my house; if I were to ever start gigging again, I'd guess it would last at least a few years of hard gigging, or quite a few years of light gigging. That said, this was also the second most expensive of the above cables -- by just a few dollars, sure, but if you absolutely know the cable won't be subject to much abuse, the Hosa or GLS Audio also seem great without compromising too much on quality.\n\nThis Hosa is my second favorite; it seems a bit more durable than the GLS Audio. The strain reliefs on this cable are not as beefy as on the Kirlin, but plenty good enough for indoor play. If you play out at all or do more than just sitting in the same chair every time you practice, I would consider the Kirlin. At the time I purchased, the Kirlin was actually a little cheaper than the Hosa, which made it a better value. The Hosa is lighter and more flexible than the Kirlin, though, which you might prefer for indoor play. If my Hosa is closer by, I definitely don't bother looking for the Kirlin -- in fact, the Hosa is the one that stays plugged in most of the time, just because that's how things happened to end up.\n\nThe Seismic Audio is the style I used to buy in high school -- definitely wouldn't rely on it for gigging, but it should be fine for most practice session use.\n\nI am playing through a small modeling amp (Fender Mustang I v2), and usually play with some light effects on -- so I'm not going through a sound system where you might really discern the difference between these inexpensive cables and a high end cable (I might be wrong about that, but wouldn't know since I've never owned a cable more than $25 before). I briefly considered a fancier cable, but honestly haven't felt like anything was missing given my current setup. If you are of a similar mindset, you won't miss out on anything with this Hosa cable."

The box is ripped partially open the microphone wasn't even placed correctly in the plastic molding that would comfortably support the microphone for shipping. The twist tie that was holding the bundle of excessive wire wasn't professionally wrapped from Factory correctly. All indications showing that this was a return product so it was not brand new out of the box. I asked you pay for something that's brand new. So I was a little nervous at first because my thoughts were why was his return this must be defective broken until I plugged it into my amplifier to test it out. And it must have been my lucky day because the microphone and it up working perfect. The on and off switch works the cable disconnect from the mic ok and I unscrewed the top of the microphone to make sure the condenser mic was not damaged by the previous people that returned it and that seems to be intact and was not damaged. So I couldn't find anything wrong with this microphone so I'm deciding to keep it but unfortunately I'm leaving the four star because I did pay for a brand new out of the box microphone and I did not receive that. Shame on the vendor for releasing such merchandise to a consumer that is paying for something that is brand new. There should have been a small discount off on something that was actually return. But I am willing to let this go for now but I would like to make it known here to Amazon and to the public. As far as the microphone it feels like a very nice quality microphone it has good weight the frequency response according to the manual is not bad and it works very well with my amplifier. Very quiet stable microphone and seems to be a good manufactured product since I've never purchase from this vendor before. I would like to say I would recommend this vendor but like I said above I did receive a used product but I do recommend the microphone"

The description calls this an AT92ECD. I got a AT92E. It looks like NOS which is fine by me. It sounded great back then and it sounds great today. There will always be better and grander cartridges but it's hard to beat the value this AT92E gives. The output is strong and I would say crisp. It provides 90% of all obtainable quality for only 10-20% of the cost. I will always be comparing against this. My previous AT92E provided me with many years of service and I expect this one will too.\n\nI replaced my old AT92E because the stylus was starting to get skewed off to one side. It only took about 16 years. :-)\n\nJust be sure to clean your records!"

Then when I plugged this one in which cost $75.00 more than the first, it didn't seem to work any better. What's the deal I thought. Finally found out what was wrong with the both of them. The end of the cable. I switched from a 1/4\" male to a XLR Male. What a deal. Both of them work fabulous. What a difference in sound. Who would have known. Make sure if you want volume and clarity, get the right cable the first time. NO 1/4\" male ends."

The sound is a bit on the bright side, which will match well with systems that sound slightly dull. Tracks very well, with minimal tracing distortion.  Separation is better than expected with proper set-up.\n\nThe only caution is that (as others have commented), the suspension is rather soft, and compliance is high.  This means the AT92e needs to be used in very light weight, low-mass tone-arms, or tracking of warped records will likely lead to bottoming out of the cartridge against the vinyl, and loads of woofer cone wobble.  For the price however, if you have an arm that's a good match, you will be very happy with the sound.  It's quite a bargain!\n\nIf you have an arm that has more mass, or a changer that requires heavier tracking forces, you might wish to look at cartridges more like the Stanton 500 series, which are a better match for higher mass arms, and heavier tracking changers."

The polarity comes physically, internally, electrically-hardwired, INVERSED, with no polarity switch on-board, and no amount of powering off and on and connecting disconnecting will do you any good. This is a contact circuit switch that has to be physically reserved by opening it up and reversing the layout of the contacts. I fixed mine, and it works great now, the three stars is for no switch and no warning that this is hardwired to be an inversed pedal.

The price on Amazon in very in line but for about $15 less you can buy an electronic gram scale. The only issue with the digital gram scale is its thickness. The electronic gram scale is so thick that the tone arm on your turntable will not be level when you weigh it. With this scale it will be.

That's why my friend gave it to me.\nI went thru the set up myself to lower action at the nut and action at fret#12. Now it plays really smooth, easy on my fingers. This is not something a casual guitar player or newbee knows.\nMost string instruments, when newly bought, need to go thru a setup to be playable. Sometimes you are lucky that the action is low enough and this can be skipped.\nThe sound is good for this price range. It does not sound as good a a few 5000$ I had chance to play and that's all expected.\nI even go further to install a preamp/under-saddel transducer to turn it into electric.\nPlugging into an amp, it sounds amazing.

The fake was very close, the counterfeiters are getting better and better even had the yellow and green wires and the indentation on the screen on top.  One dead giveaway is the weight, the fake was around 2 0z less and where the mic screws together there is a noticeable gap in a real sm. Not so with the fake it is a very tight closing gap.  I hate to admit it but the fake is not that bad especially for vocals, it doesn't compare with a real one though for instrument recording.  The fake is a more direct counterfeit of a sm 58  imo.

I personally used these in my Technics 1200 Mk5's before they got jacked and they outlasted both pairs of my Ortofon Serato Stylus's and they still work 5 years later from the day I got them.  I would recommend these for any DJ that is seasoned or not. \"SHURE IT'S YOUR SOUND\"."

I have been a DJ and hobbiest for 15 years, have taught turn tableism at Sam Ash in KOP Pa, and have competed in DMC San Antonio 2010 under a different DJ name and took 27th over all which is ok with me, but far from perfect. Right now my shop is closed up but I am getting back into the groove of things and ready to DJ again and again. I never leave for a gig without these in case there will be a throw down of DJ skills to pay da bills. I know that other DJ's have talked trash to me before about being a rapper and DJ but so was Dre when he started and now look at him. These DJ tools will allow you to get the respect and gain the skills you want from the anti skip tech which comes stock in all Shure cartridges and stylus's. They kick @$$ hands down and the name speaks for itself. Get these while they still make them. And somebody call Panasonic and say YOU NEED TO PUT TECHNICS 1200 & 1210 BACK INTO PRODUCTION!!!! WE NEED THE QUALITY BROUGHT BACK. Thanks again Shure for being totally Shure about providing a great DJ tool to remain an immortal legend handled by mortals. I love these joints and so do the other real DJ enthusiast out there. Sincerely,\nReid V.i. P. Brown aka DJ V.i. P."

        "reviewText": "Let me start this by saying that the bad reviews need to be read from a very skeptical viewpoint.  It sounds like most of the bad reviews were written by people who had purchased this for a mic that needs a different type of cable, or who don't understand the wiring of this cable and it's intended function.  With only one exception, this cable is NOT designed for a stereo camera.  That exception being a stereo microphone that uses a male 3-pin XLR jack to output an unbalanced, stereo feed across pins 2 and 3 (with pin 1 being ground).  Excepting that very rare microphone type, this should not be used for a stereo camera.\n\nThis cable is a BALANCED cable.  It is designed for Balanced XLR microphones (pretty much any professional microphone) to connect to a camera or device that uses a BALANCED 1/8\" TRS microphone input jack.  It is wired Pin 1 to Sleeve, Pin 2 to tip, and Pin 3 to Ring.  Again, it should not be used for anything with a stereo input on a 1/8\" TRS jack.\n\nFor those people wanting to use a professional XLR microphone with a stereo camcorder, you need to search for a mono XLR to Stereo 1/8\" TRS cable.  I have one, that I purchased from Amazon and it works very well for my stereo cameras.  This is not that cable.\n\nNow, that said, Here's my review... It does what it is supposed to do.  I don't really know what else to say.  I purchased this to use with my T2i running Magic lantern that allows the use of balanced mics on the external input.  When I run my T2i with the mic jack as a stereo input, I have to use my other adapter or my stereo microphone with it's own cable.  The wiring seems fine, though a little on the fragile side.  With normal home/amateur use, this will work fine.  For professional use, you probably won't be using any cameras with an 1/8\" jack anyway.  If it used a bit heavier cable and a Neutrik connector, I would give it 5 stars, but then it would cost a lot more.  For what it is, it's actually just fine.\n\nI guess my only real complaint is that it looks identical to my XLR to stereo 1/8\" TRS cable, so I had to use a sharpie to mark this one as being balanced and mark my other one as being stereo.  Not a big deal, but something to keep in mind if you get multiple Hosa adapters.\n\nEdit to add:  here is the link to the stereo cable that most people should get... HOSA XLR (F) - 3.5mm Tip/Ring/Sleeve, (wired for dual mono), 1 ft. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068NZC/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00"

        "reviewText": "I bought this to use for a series of video interviews but found it to fall far below my expectations.  I have been an avid Audio-Technica user for years and love their pro microphones.  I was hoping this would be similar in quality but my results were mixed.\n\nFirst of all, the sound quality from the microphone itself is fantastic for the price.  It is clear and crisp without being too bright.  It sounds far better than I expected for a microphone of this price.\n\nHowever, the output level of it is very low and makes it pretty much worthless.  I tried to use it four different ways and found only one of them to be usable, though it still sounded bad.\n\nThe first way was plugged directly into a camcorder.  It sounded great for about a minute or two but then the sound would fade out and for the rest of the recording, there was nothing but silence.  I attribute this more to the camcorder and not the mic since I have had other weird sound issues with other external sources on that camera.\n\nThe second way was on a different camera.  That camera has some sort of automatic gain control that boosted the mic up so loud that it was actually distorted the sound on the loud parts while bringing up the noise floor of the whole thing to about -18dbfs.  Obviously, this wasn't working the way I wanted it to.\n\nI then plugged it into the mic jack on my laptop and recorded the sound straight into the computer.  This was the only useful way that I found it would work but, because of the low output level, there was a lot of noise in the recording when boosting it to a normal level.  The background noise using this method came out to be around -26dbfs.  Though still pretty poor sounding, this would be usable.\n\nThe fourth way I tried it was my connecting it to an XLR adapter and plugging it into a pro mic preamp.  Again, the output was far too low and I got as much noise as I did usable signal.\n\nIn summary, if you have a camera that will match to the output level of this mic, you will get good sound.  However, I wouldn't hold out much hope that many cameras will meet that expectation.  Of course, at less than $20, you can probably afford to give it a shot.  I am giving it three stars mainly for the sound quality and the chance that I may eventually find a way to use it effectively."

If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches, right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches, whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up.\n\nTo conclude, would I recommend these? Yes, if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable, go for these.

I find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping.\n\nBeing able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience. Another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise. The din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion; using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information."

The shipping boxes are not the most protective.  There is no foam inside the box just a piece of cardboard on top and bottom.  Hence, both grills had dents in them from shipping.  Fortunately, I was able to tap them out but they are not perfect and should be when bought new.\n\nThe other issue is that one of the fans comes on very quickly and is considerably louder than the other fan.  The QSC tech said it was normal because the speakers were meant to be used in a loud environment and fan noise was given no consideration.  I don't buy it since the other speaker's fan is much quieter.\n\nStill I think the speakers are a good buy."

The sound was pretty good so I bought a new pair. The original phones came with a 1/4\" male plug and a 1/8\" adapter. The new ones came with a 1/8\" plug and a 1/4\" adapter. The first thing I noticed on the new pair was that the stereo separation was very poor. The left and right channels were pretty close to being the same. I tested the old headphones and the separation was noticeably better. But on the new set it is pretty poor, probably about 75% crossover on both ears. If you don't care that much about stereo channel separation, and are willing to peel off the plastic film off the foam ear cans when it starts shredding off, then this is a decent sounding set of earphone for the money.\nDiscovered a work around for the separation problem. Using the 1/4\" adapter that came with the set, I then use a 1/8\" adapter over the 1/4\" adapter, to bring the jack back to 1/8\". Using the two adapters on the 1/8\" plug seems to restore the stereo separation."

Put it in a Marantz 6300, installed it in the bedroom, and got some great new records.  At first I was a little disappointed with the sound.  It was a bit thin.  I thought that the Pickering might have aged out and perhaps the internals had dried up, hardened or softened just sitting in the case for all those years. Tried several receivers with good phono preamps but the results varied little.  Dug out some vintage external preamps but was still not delighted.  I finally got the Shure SFG-2 Tracking Force Gauge.  That was the missing link in my meticulous setup.  I've had some fine cartridges over the years, but few had the little brush attachment. Never felt the need for a brush.  I take good care of my records.  They are clean and static free.  But despite my best efforts, I quickly learned how notoriously inaccurate the calibration of even a good tonearm can be if you don't have a proper way to measure the tracking force.  Turned out the extra gram I thought I had added per the manufacturers spec to compensate for the brush was not even close.  So I used the guage, got a good reference for the stylus, added the extra gram, checked again and now I'm blasting Miles Davis Jack Johnson.  It's full, bright, has a nice throbbing bottom end.  No skips, no rumble.  A world of difference and I owe it all to getting the tracking dialed in with the help of this sweet little gauge.  Talk about money well spent!  Now I'll be setting up my Technics SL-1200 MK2 with a Stanton 681EEE downstairs in my studio.  I use that table more and I think it is pretty well balanced, but soon I will know for certain. Lesson learned.  You can't set up a good turntable without a good tracking gauge.  This is the best one I've ever used. Don't see any reason to spend big bucks on a digital gauge.  This is accurate and inexpensive and an essential tool for serious vinyl lovers."

It's most obvious flaw (small keys with only three octaves) can easily be solved.  We have a cheap, old Casio with full size keys and six octaves.  I just ran a MIDI cable out from the Casio into the Microkorg and, voila, you can play the Casio and hear the Microkorg.  Of course, I also had to buy a dual mount stand (which looks really cool), but it improved the usefulness of the Microkorg threefold.  Also, each voice on the Casio creates a new sounds with each voice on the Microkorg.  If you have the Casio volume down all the way, you can't hear its output; or, you can run a cable into the amp and hear both the actual sound of the Casio voice PLUS the Casio/Microkorg voice PLUS the Microkorg voice by itself (if you reach up and hit those keys).  Needless to say, this creates millions(?) of possible sounds.  So, get the Microkorg, get a dual mount keyboard stand, and buy some cheap old keyboard off of Craigslist, and you're set."

Actually I was curious as to IF it would actually work, and this is what I've found thus far - Once you get the Chord Buddy installed on your guitar properly it works like a charm. I installed mine on a Squier Strat and found it was very easy to adjust properly. Within a minute or so I was playing chords easily and could work on my timing & strumming. Shortly thereafter I was playing LaBamba. I believe that it is important to make sure you install it absolutely in the proper position. I did find that it fits my Squier Strat better than the acoustic I also tried it on (although it does fit the acoustic, just not quite as well - a bit of string buzz, but still playable).\nI can't speak as to whether the Chord Buddy will actually help with finger dexterity (it very well could) or help actually learning to play the chords (it might) since I've had it less than a week, but it certainly helps me work on timing & strumming as I mentioned above.\nI do believe the Chord Buddy will be an excellent tool to get my daughter more interested in playing the guitar and that is definitely a good thing. I think it's a great idea and time will tell how well it helps with finger dexterity. But for now I give it 4 Stars as it is easy to use and actually quite fun."

First, it's nearly indestructible (and trust me, between me, the kids, and various pets we have tried to destroy this).  Secondly, you can indeed get very nice music out of it.  Not talking \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" music but decent tunes with trills, etc. -  the experience of the player is what matters.  Third,  I like not having to mess around with the \"playing in\" requirements of nicer wooden instruments.  I can throw this recorder in a basket for weeks on end and then play it for as long as I want to play it without having to worry about it being humidified properly.  HOWEVER, the tuning of this instrument is frankly a little bit luck of the draw.  My recorder runs flat at the higher register (starting with high C and getting flatter as it goes). My daughter's Yamaha runs sharp in about the same area.  The tuning issue honestly isn't very noticeable if we're playing by ourselves, but is pretty awful sounding when we play together.  Now if you're really into ensemble work, you buy a nice wooden instrument and make sure the shop checks and fixes the tuning before you take it home. This is a mass produced recorder and - if you're buying it online - you get what you get. That said, it really is decent for the price and once you (or your kid) gets the hang of it, you can blow a little harder or softer to correct the majority of manufacturer imprecisions.\n\nETA:  Note that this recorder is the *Baroque* version, which is what my kid uses in school.  This means that the low F is split fingered (fingers down on left plus 1&3 on right... and yep, two fingers is good enough to sound in tune and easier to learn for beginners)"

So i cut the RCA plugs off of them and stuck the wires into the back of my old Sony reciever and they work.\n\nAnyway, back to the needle. This fit in perfectly to my RX3P cartridge. As soon as it was installed, I went thumbing thru my record bins to figure out what to play, and decided on a couple Moody Blues LPs. They sounded fantastic.

The trumpet fell on a hard floor and damaged the 2nd valve slide assembly; after hundreds in repair bills, it never worked well again.\n\nThe problem is that this stand has a fatal design flaw, in that it tips over far too easily with your instrument on it.\n\nThousands of these tip-prone stands were sold (and are still in use) before K&M invented the much-more-stable , FIVE legged stand.  Search Amazon on:  K M trumpet stand\n\nK & M should discontinue this three-leg model."

Is it perfectly crystal clear? No, and anyone who expects that without dropping hundreds on a high end lav mic system is delusional. However there are easy things you can do in post production to make it better. I edit on Adobe Premiere Pro and all I do to clean up the sound is use the \"denoiser\" effect and set the noise reduction to -8 and voila, done. It takes literally 5 seconds and the result is perfectly acceptable broadcast quality sound for the projects I work on.\n\nThere will always be people who cry and complain when they don't get $1000 performance out of a $100 product. Don't listen to them. They're dumb. You get what you pay for and occasionally, if you're lucky, a little more...this is one of those cases.\n\nI like it so much in fact that I'm buying another one."

Always work over a bench or table when connecting cause these nuts and washers are small. I dropped when on my tile floor and took me a minute with a flashlight to find it.

It's got a lot of power and volume.\n\nThe bass, treble, and gain controls are simple but give you a lot of room to define your own sound. The gain on the clean channel sounds great. The dirty channel provides a great fuzz tone on its own.\n\nWhen I want a heavier sound I switch to the clean channel and run my effects through it.\n\nI can recommend this amp for a wide range of styles and tones. Everything from thin Tele or Strats to Gibsons, single coil or humbuckers, and even acoustic-electrics; they'll all work great with this amp.\n\nI've always been a fan of the warm Vox sound and they didn't skimp on this small practice amp. This is definitely an affordable, quality amp you can use for practice and even jamming with a band (it does have that much volume)."
